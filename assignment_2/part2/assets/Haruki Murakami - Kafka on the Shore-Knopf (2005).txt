The Boy Named Crow

s

o you're all set for money, then?" the boy named Crow asks in his typi­
cal sluggish voice. The kind of voice like when you've just woken up
and your mouth still feels heavy and dull. But he's just pretending. He's

totally awake. As always.
I nod.
"How much?"
I review the numbers in my head. "Close to thirty-five hundred in cash,
plus some money I can get from an ATM. I know it's not a lot, but it should
be enough. For the time being."
"Not bad," the boy named Crow says. "For the time being."
I give him another nod.
'Tm guessing this isn't Christmas money from Santa Claus."
"Yeah, you're right," I reply.
Crow smirks and looks around. "I imagine you've started by rifling draw­
ers, am I right?"
I don't say anything. He knows whose money we're talking about, so
there's no need for any long-winded interrogations. He's just giving me a
hard time.
"No matter," Crow says. "You really need this money and you're going to
get it-beg, borrow, or steal. It's your father's money, so who cares, right? Get
your hands on that much and you should be able to make it. For the time

being. But what's the plan after it's all gone? Money isn't like mushrooms in a
forest- it doesn't just pop up on its own, you know. You'll need to eat, a place
to sleep. One day you're going to run out."
'Til think about that when the time comes," I say.

"When the time comes," Crow repeats, as if weighing these words in his
hand.
I nod.
"Like by getting a job or something?"

"Maybe," I say.
Crow shakes his head. "You know, you've got a lot to learn about the
world. Listen- what kind of job could a fifteen-year-old kid get in some far­
off place he's never been to before? You haven't even finished junior high.
Who do you think's going to hire you?"
I blush a little. It doesn't take much to make me blush.
"Forget it," he says. "You're just getting started and I shouldn't lay all this
depressing stuff on you. You've already decided what you're going to do, and
all that's left is to set the wheels in motion. I mean, it's your life. Basically you
gotta go with what you think is right."
That's right. When all is said and done, it is my life.
''I'll tell you one thing, though. You're going to have to get a lot tougher if
you want to make it."
'Tm trying my best," I say.
'Tm sure you are," Crow says. "These last few years you've gotten a whole
lot stronger. I've got to hand it to you."
I nod again.
"But let's face it- you're only fifteen," Crow goes on. "Your life's just
begun and there's a ton of things out in the world you've never laid eyes on.
Things you never could imagine."
As always, we're sitting beside each other on the old sofa in my father's
study. Crow loves the study and all the little objects scattered around there.
Now he's toying with a bee-shaped glass paperweight. If my father was at
home, you can bet Crow would never go anywhere near it.
"But I have to get out of here," I tell him. "No two ways around it."
"Yeah, I guess you're right." He places the paperweight back on the table
and links his hands behind his head. "Not that running away's going to solve
everything. I don't want to rain on your parade or anything, but I wouldn't
count on escaping this place if I were you. No matter how far you run. Dis­
tance might not solve anything."
The boy named Crow lets out a sigh, then rests a fingertip on each of his
closed eyelids and speaks to me from the darkness within.
"How about we play our game?" he says.
"All right," I say. I close my eyes and quietly take a deep breath.
"Okay, picture a terrible sandstorm," he says. "Get everything else out of
your head."
I do what he says, get everything else out of my head. I forget who I am,
even. I'm a total blank. Then things start to surface. Things that- as we sit
here on the old leather sofa in my father's study-both of us can see.

"Sometimes fate is like a small sandstorm tha t keeps changing direc­
tions," Crow says.
Sometimes fate is like a small sandstorm that keeps changing direc­
tions. You change direction but the sandstorm chases you. You turn again,
but the storm adjusts. Over and over you play this out, like some ominous
dance with death just before dawn. Why? Because this storm isn't some­
thing that blew in from far away, something that has nothing to do with
you. This storm is you. Something inside of you. So all you can do is give
in to it, step right inside the storm, closing your eyes and plugging up your
ears so the sand doesn't get in, and walk through it, step by step. There's
no sun there, no moon, no direction, no sense of time. Just fine white sand
swirling up into the sky like pulverized bones. That's the kind of sand­
storm you need to imagine.
And that's exactly what I do. I imagine a white funnel stretching up verti­
cally like a thick rope. My eyes are closed tight, hands cupped over my ears,
so those fine grains of sand can't blow inside me. The sandstorm draws
steadily closer. I can feel the air pressing on my skin. It really is going to swal­
low me up.
The boy called Crow softly rests a hand on my shoulder, and with that
the storm vanishes.
"From now on- no matter what-you've got to be the world's toughest
fifteen-year-old. That's the only way you're going to survive. And in order
to clo that, you've got to figure out what it means to be tough. You follow­
ing me?"
I keep my eyes closed ancl don' t reply. I just want to sink off into sleep like
this, his hand on my shoulder. I hear the faint flutter of wings.
"You're going to be the world's toughest fifteen-year-old," Crow whispers
as I try to fall asleep. Like he was carving the words in a deep blue tattoo on
my heart.

And you really will have to make it through that violent, metaphysical,
symbolic storm. No matter how metaphysical or symbolic it might be,
make no mistake about it: it will cut through flesh like a thousand razor
blades. People will bleed there, and you will bleed too. Hot, red blood.
You'll catch that blood in your hands, your own blood and the blood
of others.
And once the storm is over you won't remember how you made it
through, how you managed to survive. You won't even be sure, in fact,

5

whether the storm is really over. But one thing is certain. \Vhen you come
out of the storm you won't be the same person who walked in. That's what
this storm's all about.
On my fifteenth birthday I'll run away from home, journey to a far-off
town, and live in a corner of a small library. It'd take a week to go into the
whole thing, all the details. So I'll just give the main point. On my fifteenth
birthday I'll run away from home, journey to a far-off town, and live in a
corner of a small library.
It sounds a little like a fairy tale. But it's no fairy tale, believe me. No
matter what sort of spin you put on it.

Chapter 1

C

ash isn't the only thing I take from my father's study when I leave
home. I take a small, old gold lighter-I like the design and feel of
it-and a folding knife with a really sharp blade. Made to skin deer, it

has a five-inch blade and a nice heft. Probably something he bought on one
of his trips abroad. I also take a sturdy, bright pocket flashlight out of a drawer.
Plus sky blue Revo sunglasses to disguise my age.
I think about taking my father's favorite Sea-Dweller Oyster Rolex. It's a
beautiful watch, but something flashy will only attract attention. My cheap
plastic Casio watch with an alarm and stopwatch will do just fine, and might
actually be more useful. Reluctantly, I return the Rolex to its drawer.
From the back of another drawer I take out a photo of me and my older
sister when we were little, the two of us on a beach somewhere with grins
plastered across our faces. My sister's looking off to the side so half her face is
in shadow and her smile is neatly cut in half. It's like one of those Greek
tragedy masks in a textbook that's half one idea and half the opposite. Light
and dark. Hope and despair. Laughter and sadness. Trust and loneliness. ror
my part I'm staring straight ahead, undaunted, at the camera. Nobody else is
there at the beach. My sister and I have on swimsuits-hers a red floral-print
one-piece, mine some baggy old blue trunks. I'm holding a plastic stick in my
hand. White foam is washing over our feet.
Who took this, and where and when, I have no clue. And how could I have
looked so happy? And why did my father keep just that one photo? The whole
thing is a total mystery. I must have been three, my sister nine. Did we ever
really get along that well? I have no memory of ever going to the beach with my
family. No memory of going anywhere with them. No matter, though -there is
no way I'm going to leave that photo with my father, so I put it in my wallet. I
don't have any photos of my mother. My father threw them all away.
After giving it some thought I decide to take the cell phone with me. Once
he finds out I've taken it, my father will probably get the phone company to

7

cut off service. Still, I toss it into my backpack, along with the adapter. Doesn't
add much weight, so why not. When it doesn't work anymore I'll just chuck it.

Just the bare necessities, that's all I need. Choosing which clothes to take is
the hardest thing. I'll need a couple sweaters and pairs of underwear. But
what about shirts and trousers? Gloves, mufflers, shorts, a coat? There's no
end to it. One thing I do know, though. I don't want to wander around some
strange place with a huge backpack that screams out, Hey, everybody, check

out the runaway! Do that and someone is sure to sit up and take notice. Next
thing you know the police will haul me in and I'll be sent straight home. If I
don't wind up in some gang first.
Any place cold is definitely out, I decide. Easy enough, just choose the
opposite-a wamz place. Then I can leave the coat and gloves behind, and
get by with half the clothes. I pick out wash-and-wear-type things, the lightest
ones I have, fold them neatly, and stuff them in my backpack. I also pack a
three-season sleeping bag, the kind that rolls up nice and tight, toilet stuff, a
rain poncho, notebook and pen, a Walkman and ten discs-got to have my
music-along with a spare rechargeable battery. That's about it. No need for
any cooking gear, which is too heavy and takes up too much room, since I
can buy food at the local convenience store.
It takes a while but I'm able to subtract a lot of things from my list.
I add things, cross them off, then add a whole other bunch and cross them
off, too.

My fifteenth birthday is the ideal time to run away from home. Any earlier
and it'd be too soon. Any later and I would have missed my chance.
During my first two years in junior high, I'd worked out, training myself
for this day. I started practicing judo in the first couple years of grade school,
and still went sometimes in junior high. But I didn't join any school teams.
Whenever I had the time I'd jog around the school grounds, swim, or go to
the local gym. The young trainers there gave me free lessons, showing me the
best kind of stretching exercises and how to use the fitness machines to bulk
up. They taught me which muscles you use every day and which ones can
only be built up with machines, even the correct way to do a bench press. I'm
pretty tall to begin with, and with all this exercise I've developed pretty broad
shoulders and pecs. Most strangers would take me for seventeen. If! ran away
looking my actual age, you can imagine all the problems that would cause.

8

Other than the trainers at the gym and the housekeeper who comes to
our house every other day-and of course the bare minimum required to get
by at school- I barely talk to anyone. For a long time my father and I have
avoided seeing each other. We live under the same roof, but our schedules
are totally different. He spends most of his time in his studio, far away, and I
do my best to avoid him.
The school I'm going to is a private junior high for kids who are upper­
class, or at least rich. It's the kind of school where, unless you really blow it,
you're automatically promoted to the high school on the same campus. All
the students dress neatly, have nice straight teeth, and are boring as hell. Nat­
urally I have zero friends. I've built a wall around me, never letting anybody
inside and trying not to venture outside myself. Who could like somebody
like that? They all keep an eye on me, from a distance. They might hate me,
or even be afraid of me, but I'm just glad they didn't bother me. Because I
had tons of things to take care of, including spending a lot of my free time
devouring books in the school library.
I always paid close attention to what was said in class, though. Just like
the boy named Crow suggested.
The facts and techniques or whatever they teach you in class isn't
going to be very useful in the real world, that's for sure. Let's face it, teach­
ers are basically a bunch of morons. But you've got to remember this:
you're running away from home. You probably won't have any chance to
go to school anymore, so like it or not you'd better absorb whatever you
can while you've got the chance. Become like a sheet of blotting paper and
soak it all in. Later on you can figure out what to keep and what to unload.

I did what he said, like I almost always do. My brain like a sponge, I focused
on every word said in class and let it all sink in, figured out what it meant, and
committed everything to memory. Thanks to this, I barely had to study out­
side of class, but always came out near the top on exams.
My muscles were getting hard as steel, even as I grew more withdrawn
and quiet. I tried hard to keep my emotions from showing so that no one­
classmates and teachers alike-had a clue what I was thinking. Soon I'd be
launched into the rough adult world, and I knew I'd have to be tougher than
anybody if I wanted to survive.
My eyes in the mirror are cold as a lizard's, my expression fixed and
unreadable. I can't remember the last time I laughed or even showed a hint
of a smile to other people. Even to myself.

9

I'm not trying to imply I can keep up this silent, isolated facade all the
time. Sometimes the wall I've erected around me comes crumbling down. It
doesn't happen very often, but sometimes, before I even realize what's going
on, there I am-naked and defenseless and totally confused. At times like
that I always feel an omen calling out to me, like a dark, omnipresent pool
of water.

A dark, omnipresent pool of water.
It was probably always there, hidden away somewhere. But when the
time comes it silently rushes out, chilling every cell in your body. You
drown in that cruel flood, gasping for breath. You cling to a vent near the
ceiling, struggling, but the air you manage to breathe is dry and burns
your throat. Water and thirst, cold and heat-these supposedly opposite
elements combine to assault you.
The world is a huge space, but the space that will take you in-and it
doesn't have to be very big-is nowhere to be found. You seek a voice, but
what do you get? Silence. You look for silence, but guess what? All you
hear over and over and over is the voice of this omen. And sometimes this
prophetic voice pushes a secret switch hidden deep inside your brain.
Your heart is like a great river after a long spell of rain, spilling over its
banks. All signposts that once stood on the ground are gone, inundated
and carried away by that rush of water. And still the rain beats down on the
surface of the river. Every time you see a flood like that on the news you
tell yourself: That's it. That's my heart.
Before running away from home I wash my hands and face, trim my
nails, swab out my ears, and brush my teeth. I take my time, making sure my
whole body's well scrubbed. Being really clean is sometimes the most impor­
tant thing there is. I gaze carefully at my face in the mirror. Genes I'd gotten
from my father and mother-not that I have any recollection of what she
looked like-created this face. I can do my best to not let any emotions show,
keep my eyes from revealing anything, bulk lip my muscles, but there's not
much I can do about my looks. I'm stuck with my father's long, thick eye­
brows and the deep lines between them. I could probably kill him if I wanted
to- I'm sure strong enough-and I can erase my mother from my memory.
But there's no way to erase the DNA they passed down to me. If I wanted to
drive that away I'd have to get rid of

me.

There's an omen contained in that. A mechanism buried inside of me.
A mechanism buried inside of you.

I switc h o ff the l i ght and leave the bath roo m . A heavy, damp still ness l ies
over the ho use. The wh ispers of people who do n't exist, the breath o f the
dead. I look a ro u n d , standing stock-sti l l , and take a deep breath . The c lock
shows three p . m . , the two hands col d and distant. They 're pretending to be
nonco mmitta l , but I know th ey 're no t on my s i d e . It's nearly time fo r m e to
say good-by e . I p ick up my backpack and slip it over my sho u l de rs . I 've c a r­

S h i koku , I dec i d e . That's where I'll go . There's no partic u l a r reaso n i t has

mainland by water, with a warm c l i mate . I 've n ever been th ere, have no
friends o r relatives there , so if so mebody started looking fo r me - which I
kind of do ubt- S h i koku wo uld be the last plac e th ey 'd th i n k of.

I pick up the ticket I 'd reserved at the co unter and c l i m b abo a rd the n ight
bus. Th i s is the c h eapest way to get to Takamatsu - j ust a shade over n i n ety

Only a th i rd of the seats a re take n . Most passengers are trave l i n g a lo n e ,

do n 't mind. I 've got plenty of time. Th e bus pulls out of the statio n at eight,

U.S. ARMY INTELLIGENCE SECTION (MIS) REPORT
Dated: May 12, 1946
Title: Report on the Rice Bowl Hill Incident, 1944
Document Number: PTYX-722-8936745-42213-WWN

The following is a taped interview with Setsuko Okamochi (26), teacher in
charge of the fourth-grade B class at the public school in [deleted] Town,
[deleted] County. Materials related to the interview can be accessed using
application number PTYX-722-SQ-1l8.
Impressions of the interviewer, Lt. Robert O'Connor:

Setsuko

Okamochi is an attractive, petite woman. Intelligent and responsible, she
responded to the questions accurately and honestly. She still seems
slightly in shock, though, from the incident. As she searched her memory
she grew very tense at times, and whenever this happened she had a ten­
dency to speak more slowly.

I th ink it must have been j ust after ten in the morning whe n I saw a s i lver l ight
fa r up in the sky. A brilliant flash of s ilver. That's right, it was defin itely l i ght
reflecting off someth ing metal . That l ight moved ve ry slowly i n the sky from
east to west. We all thought it had to be a B-29 . It was di rectly above us, so to
see it we had to look stra ight up. It was a clear blue sky, a n d the l ight was
so bright all we could see was that s i lver, duralumi n-like obj ect.
But we couldn't make out the shape, since it was too fa r up. I assumed
that they couldn't see us either, so we weren't afra id of being attacked or
having bombs suddenly ra i n down on us. Dropp i n g bombs i n the moun­
tains h e re would be pretty poi ntless a nyway. I figured the plane was o n its
way to bomb some large city somewhere, or maybe on i ts way back fro m a
ra i d . So we kept on walking. All I thought was how that l ight had a strange
beauty to it.
- According to military records no U.S. bombers or any other kind of
aircraft were flying over that region at the time, that is, around ten a.m. on
November 7, 1944'
But I saw it clearly, and so did the s ixteen c h i l d ren in my class. Al l of us
thought i t had to be a B-29. We'd all seen many formations of B-29s , and th ose
are th e only kind of planes that could possibly fly that h igh . There was a small
a i rbase i n our prefecture , and I 'd occasionally seen Japanese planes flying,
but they were all small and could never fly as h igh as what I saw. Besides, the
way dura l u m i n reflects l ight i s different from other types of meta l , and the
only planes made out of that a re B-29s. I did th i nk it was a l i ttle strange,
though , that it was a solo plane flying all by itself, not part of a formati o n .

- Were you born in this region?
N o , I was born in H i rosh i m a . I got married in 1941, and that's when I
came here. My husband was a music teacher in a j unior h igh school i n th i s
prefecture. H e was called up i n 1943 a n d d i e d fighting i n Luzon i n J u n e o f
1945. From what I heard later, he was guarding an ammunition d u m p j ust

outside Manila when it was hit by American shells and blew up, k i l l i n g h i m .
We have n o c h i ldren.
- Speaking of children, how many were you

III

charge of on that

outing?
S i xteen all togeth er, boys and girls. Two were out s i ck, but oth e r tha n that
i t was the entire class. E i ght boys and eight girls. F ive of th em were c h i ldren
who'd been evacuated from Tokyo .
We set out from the school at nine in the morning. It was a typ ical school
outing, so everyone carried canteens and lunches with th e m . We had noth i n g
i n pa rticular w e were planning t o study; w e were j ust g o i n g up i nto t h e h i l l s to
gathe r mushrooms and edible wild plants . The area around where we l ived
was farmland, so we weren't that badly off i n terms of food - wh ich i s n 't to say
we had plenty to eat. There was a strict rationing system in place and most of
us were h ungry all th e time.
So the c h i ldren were encouraged to hunt for food wh erever they could
fi n d it. The country was at war, after a l l , and food took priority over studyi ng.
Everyon e went on th i s kind of school outing - outdoo r study

sessions, as they

were called. S i n c e our school was surrounded by h i l l s and woods , there were
a lot of nice spots we used to go to . I th ink we were blessed i n that sense .
People i n cities were all starving. Supply routes from Ta iwan and the conti­
nent had been cut off by th is time and urban areas were suffe r i n g te rribly
from a lack of food and fue l .
- You mentioned that five o f your pupils had been evacuated from
Tokyo. Did they get along well with the local children?
In my class at least they did. The environments the two groups grew li p
i n , of course , were completely different - one way out in the country, the
oth e r i n the heart of Tokyo . They spoke differently, even dressed differently.
Most of the local kids were from poor farming fam i l i e s , wh i l e the m a j ority of

the Tokyo c h i l dren had fath ers who wo rked fo r co mpanies o r in the civil ser­
vice. So I co uldn't say they really unde rstood each other.
Especially i n the begi nning yo u co uld sense so me ten s io n betwee n the
two groups. I'm not saying they bullied each other o r got i n to fights , because
they didn 't. What I mean i s o n e group didn't seem to u n d e rstand what the
other gro u p was th inking. So they tended to keep to themselves, the local kids
with other lo cal kids, the Tokyo children i n th eir own l i ttl e gro u p . Th is was
o nly the fi rst two mo nths, though . After that they got alo n g wel l . Yo u know
how it is. Wh e n kids start playing together and get co mpletely absorbed by
whateve r they're do ing, they do n't care about th ings l ike that a nymo r e .
- I'd like you t o describe, i n a s much detail a s you can, the spot where
you took your class that day.
It was a h i l l we often went to on o utings. It was a ro u n d h i l l shaped l ike
an upside-down bowl . We usually called it " Owan yama." [ Note: " Ri c e Bowl
H i lL" ] It was a short walk to the west of the schoo l and was n 't steep at a l l , so
anybody co uld c l i mb it. At th e childre n 's pace it took so mewhere a ro u n d two
ho urs to get to the top . Alo ng the way they'd search the woods fo r mushroo ms
and we 'd have a simple lunch . The children, natural ly, e n joyed go ing on
these outdoo r sessio ns much mo re than staying i n o u r classroo m studying.
The gl itte r i n g a i rplane we saw way up i n the sky reminded u s fo r a
mo ment of the war, but j ust fo r a sho rt time, and we were all i n a good mood .
There wasn't a c lo u d i n the sky, no wind, a n d everyth i n g w a s qu i et a ro u n d
us - all w e co uld hear were b i rds c h i rping i n t h e woo ds. T h e w a r s e e m e d l ike
so meth i n g i n a faraway land that had noth ing to do with us. We sang so ngs as
we h iked up the h i l l , so metimes imitating the b i rds we heard. Except fo r the
fact that the war was still go ing on, it was a perfect mo rning.
- It was soon after you observed the airplane-like object that you went
into the woods, correct?
That's co rrect. I 'd say it was less than five mi nutes later that we went i n to
the woo ds. We left the m a i n tra i l up the hill and went alo n g a trampled-down
path that went up the slope o f the woods. It was pretty steep. After we 'd h iked
fo r abo u t ten mi nutes we came to a clearing, a broad area as Aat as a tableto p .
O n c e we'd e ntered t h e woo ds it was co mpletely sti l l , and with t h e s u n
blocked out it w a s c h i l ly, but w h e n we stepped into that clearing it w a s l ike

we were in a m i n iature town square, with th e sky bright above us. My class
often stopped by th i s spot whenever we cl imbed Owan yama. The place had
a calming eff ect, and somehow made us all feel nice and cozy.
We took a b reak once we reached th i s "square ," putti ng down our packs,
and then the c h i l d re n went i nto the woods i n groups of three or four in search
of mushrooms. I i n s i sted that they never lose sight of one anoth er. Before th ey
set out, I gathered th em all together and made sure they understood th i s . We
knew the place wel l , but it was a woods, after a l l , and i f any of th em got sepa­
rated and lost we'd have a hard time finding the m . Still, you have to remem­
ber these are small ch ildren, and once they start hunting mushrooms th ey
tend to forget th i s rul e . So I always made sure that as I l ooked for mushrooms
myself I kept an eye on th em, and a ru nning head count.
I t was about ten mi nutes or so after we began h u n ting mushrooms that
the c h i l d re n started to collapse.
Wh en I fi rst spotted a group of th ree of them collapsed on the gro u n d
I w a s s u r e they'd eaten poisonous mushrooms . There a r e a lot of h ighly toxic
mushrooms around here, even ones that can be fatal . The local kids know
wh i c h ones not to pick, but a few varieties are hard to distingu ish . That's why
I always warned the c h ildren never to put any i n th e i r mouths until we got
back to school and had an expert check th e m . But you can't always expect
kids to l i sten , can you?
I raced over to the spot and l ifted up the c h i ldren who'd fal l e n to the
gro u n d . Th eir bodies were l i mp, l ike rubber that's been left out i n the s u n . I t
w a s l ike carryi ng empty shells - the strength was completely d ra i ned fro m
th e m . But they were b reathing fi n e . Th eir pulses were norm a l , and none o f
th em h a d a temperatur e . They looked c a l m , n o t at all l ike they were i n a n y
p a i n . I ruled o u t th i ngs like b e e sti ngs or snakebites. T h e ch ildren were
s i mply unconscious.
The strangest th ing was their eyes. Their bodies were so l i mp i t was l ike
they were i n a coma, yet their eyes were open as i f they were looking at some­
th ing. They'd b l i nk every once in a wh i l e , so it wasn't l ike they were asleep.
And the i r eyes moved very slowly from side to side l ike they were scanning a
distant horizon. Their eyes at least were conscious. But they weren 't actually
looking at a nyth ing, or at least nothing visibl e . I waved my hand a few times
i n front of th eir faces, but got no reacti o n .
I p i cked up e a c h of t h e three children i n tu rn , and they w e r e all exactly
the same. All of them were unconscious, th eir eyes slowly moving from side
to s i d e . I t was the wei rdest th ing I 'd ever seen.

- Describe the group that first collapsed.
It was a group of girls. Three girls who were all good friends. I called out
their names and slapped them on the cheek, pretty hard, i n fact, but there
was no reaction. They didn't feel a th ing. It was a strange fee l i ng, l ike touch­
i n g a void.
My fi rst thought was to send som ebody running back to the school for
help. There was no way I could carry th ree unconscious c h i ldren down by
myself. So I sta rted l ooking for the fastest ru nner in the class, one of the boys.
But when I stood up and looked around I saw that

all th e c h i ldren had col­

lapsed. All sixtee n of them had fallen to the ground and lost consciousness.
The only one still conscious and standing was me. It was l ike ... a

battlefield.

- Did you notice anything unusual at the scene? Any strange smell or
sound - or a light?
[Th i nks about it for a wh i l e.] No, as I already said, it was ve ry quiet and
peaceful. No unusual sounds or l ight or smells. The only th i n g u nusual was
that every s i ngle pupil i n my class had collapsed and was lying there uncon­
scious. I felt utterly alone, l ike I was the last person al ive o n E arth. I can't
describe that fee l i ng of total lonel i ness. I j ust wanted to disappear i n to th i n a i r
a n d n o t th ink about a nyth ing.
Of course I couldn't do that - I had my duty as a teacher. I pulled myself
togethe r and raced down the slope as fast as my l egs would carry me, to get
help at the sch ool.

Chapter 3

I

t's nearly dawn whe n I wake up. I draw the curta i n back and take a look.
I t must have j ust stopped ra i n i ng, since everyth i n g i s stil l wet and drippy.
Clouds to the east are sharply etched aga inst the sky, each one framed by

l ight. The sky l ooks omi nous one minute , inviting the n ext. I t all depends on
the angl e .
T h e b u s plows down the h ighway at a s e t speed, t h e tires h u m m i n g
a l o n g , never getting a n y louder or softer. S a m e with t h e engi n e , i t s monoto­
nous sound l ike a mortar smoothly grinding down time and the conscious­
ness of the people on board . Th e other passengers a re all sunk back in the i r
seats , asleep, the i r curtains drawn tight. T h e driver and I a r e t h e o n l y ones
awake. We 're being carried, efficiently and numbly, toward our destinatio n .
Fee l i n g th i rsty, I take a bottle of mineral water from t h e pocket of m y
backpack a n d d r i n k some o f the lukewarm water. From t h e s a m e pocket I
pull out a box of soda c rackers and mu nch a few, e n j oying that fam i l i a r d ry
taste . According to my watch it's 4:32. I check the date and day of the week,
j ust to be on the safe side. Th i rteen hours since I left home. Time hasn't
l eaped ahead more than it should or done an unexpected about-fa c e . It's still
my b i rthday, stil l the fi rst day of my brand-new l i fe . I shut my eyes, open th e m
aga i n , aga i n checking the time a n d date on m y watc h . Th e n I switch on the
reading l i ght, take out a paperback book, and start readi ng.

Just after five , without warning, the bus pulls off the h i ghway and comes to a
stop in a corner of a roads ide rest area. The front door of the bus opens with
a n a i ry h iss, l i ghts blink on inside, and the bus driver makes a brief a n n o u nce­
ment. " Good morning, eve rybody. Hope you had a good rest. We 're on sched­
ule and should arrive i n our final stop at Takamatsu Station in about a n h o u r.
But we 're stoppi n g here for a twenty-mi nute break. We 'll be leaving aga i n at
five-th i rty, so please be sure to be back on board by the n ."

The announcement wakes up most of the pass engers , and they s i l ently
struggl e to their feet, yawning as they stumble out of the b us . Th is is where
people make th ems e lves presentable before arriving i n Takamats u . I get off
too, take a couple of deep b reaths , and do some s i mple stretc h i n g exercis es i n
the fres h morning a i r. I walk over to the men's room a n d splas h s o m e water
on my fac e . I'm wondering where the heck we are. I go outs ide and look
arou n d . Noth i n g special, j ust the typical roads i d e scenery you fi n d next to a
h ighway. Maybe I ' m j ust imagining th ings , but the shape of the h i l ls and the
color of the trees seem different from thos e back i n Tokyo .
I ' m i ns i d e the cafeteria s ipping a free cup of hot tea when th is young g i rl
comes over and plunks herself down on the plastic s eat n ext to m e . In h e r
right hand s h e h as a pape r cup of h o t coffee s h e bought fro m a vending
mach i n e , the steam ris i ng up from it, and i n her left hand s h e 's holding a
small conta i n e r with sandwiches i ns i d e - another b i t of vending-mac h i n e
gourmet fa re , by t h e looks of it.
S h e 's kind of fu nny looking. Her face is out of balance - broad forehead,
button n os e , freckled cheeks , and pointy ears . A slammed-togeth er, rough
s o rt of face you can't ignore . Sti l l , the whole package is n't s o bad. For all I
know maybe s h e 's not so wild about her own looks , but s h e s e e ms comfort­
able with who s h e is , and that's the important th ing. Th ere's someth i n g c h ild­
ish about h e r that has a calming effect, at least on me. Sh e is n 't very tal l , but
has good-looking legs and a nice bust for such a s l i m body.
H e r th i n metal earri ngs sparkle l ike dura l u m i n . She wears h e r dark
brown , almost reddish dyed h a i r down to her shoulders , and h as on a l ong­
sl eeved crewneck s h i rt with wide stripes . A small leath e r backpack hangs
from one shoulder, and a l ight sweater's tied around h e r neck. A cream­
colored m i n is k i rt completes her outfit, with no stockings . S h e 's evi dently
washed her fac e , s i nce a few strands of hair, l ike the th i n roots of a plant, are
plastered to her b road forehead. Strangely enough, thos e l oos e strands of h a i r
draw me t o h e r.
"You were on the bus , weren't you ? " she asks m e , her voi ce a l i ttle h usky.
"Yeah, that's right."
She frowns as s h e takes a s ip of th e coffee. " H ow old are you ? "
" S evente e n ," I l i e .
" S o you 're i n h i gh school."
I nod.
"Wh e re 're you headed?"
"Takamats u ."
" Same with me," s h e says . "Are you visiting, or do you liv e there?"

"V i s i ti ng," I reply.
" Me too. I have a friend the re . A girlfriend of m i ne . H ow about you ? "
" Relatives."

I

see,

her nod says . No more questi ons. 'Tve got a younge r b rother the

same age as you ," she suddenly tells me , as if she 'd just remembe re d . 'Th i n gs
happene d , and we haven't seen each othe r for a long time . . . . You know
someth i ng? You look a lot like that guy. Anybody eve r tel l you that?"

"What guy? "
"You know, the guy who s i ngs in that band! As soon as I saw you i n the
bus I thought you l ooked l i ke h i m , but I j ust can't come up with h i s name . I
must have busted a hole in my bra i n trying to remembe r. That happens
sometime s , right? I t's on the tip of your tongue , but you j ust can't th ink of
it. Hasn't anybody said that to you before - that you remind them of some­
body?"
I shake my head. Nobody's ever said that to me . S he 's still staring at me ,
eyes narrowed intently. "What kind of person do you mea n ? " I ask.
"A TV guy."
"A guy wh o 's on TV ?"
"Right," she says, picking up he r ham sandwich and taking a n uninspire d
b i te , wash i n g it down with a sip of coffee . " A g u y w h o sings i n some band.

Darn-I can't th ink of the band's name , either. Th i s tall guy who has a
Kansai accent. You don't have any idea who I mea n ? "
" S orry, I don't watch TV."
The girl frowns and gives me a hard look. "You don't watch at a l l ? "
I shake m y head s i lently. Wa it a sec - should I nod or shake my head
here ? I go with the nod.
"Not very talkative , are you? One l i ne at a time seems your style . Are you
always so qu iet?"
I blush. I'm sort of a quiet type to begin with , but part of the reason I don't
want to say much i s that my voice hasn't changed complete ly. Most of the
time I 've got kind of a low voice , but all of a sudde n it turns on me and lets out
a squeak. S o I try to keep whatever I say short and sweet.
"Anyway," she goes on, "what I'm trying to say i s you look a lot l i ke that
s i nge r with the Kansai accent. Not that you have a Kansai accent or a nyth ing.
I t's jllst - I don't know, there's someth ing about you that's a lot l i ke him. He
see ms l ike a real nice guy, that's all."
Her smile steps offstage for a moment, then does a n encore , a l l wh i le I ' m
dea l i n g with m y blushing face . "You'd resemble h i m even more i f you
changed you r h a i r," she says . "Let it grow out a l i ttle , use some gel to make it

20

fl i p up a bit. I 'd l ove to give it a try. You 'd definitely look good l ike that. Actu­
al ly, I ' m a h a i rd resser."
I nod and sip my tea . The cafeteria is dead silent. None of the usual back­
ground mus i c , n obody else talking besides the two of us.
" Maybe you don't l ike talking?" she says , resting h e r head i n one hand
and giving me a serious look.
I shake my head. "No, that's not it."
"You th ink i t's a pain to talk to people?"
One more shake of my head.
S h e p i cks u p her other sandwich with strawberry jam i nstead of h a m ,
then frowns and gives me th i s l ook of disbe l i ef. "Would y o u e a t th i s for m e ?
I hate strawbe rry- j a m sandwiches more than anyth ing. E v e r s i n c e I w a s a k i d . "
I take i t from her. Strawberry-jam sandwiches a r e n ' t exactly o n my top­
ten l ist either, but I don't say a word and start eating.
From across the table she watches until I finish eve ry last c ru m b . " C o u l d
y o u do me a favor?" she says .
"A favor?"
" C a n I sit n ext to you until we get to Taka matsu? I just can't relax when I
sit by myself. I a lways feel l ike some weird person 's goin g to plop h i mself
down next to me, and then I can't get to sleep. Wh e n I bought my ticket they
told me they were all s i ngle seats, but wh en I got on I saw they're all doubles.
I j ust want to catch a few wi nks before we a rrive , and you seem l ike a nice
guy. D o you m i n d ? "
" N o probl e m . "
"Thanks ," she says . " ' I n travel ing, a companion: as t h e saying goes ."
I n o d . N o d , nod, nod - that's all I seem capable of. But what should I say?
" H ow does that end?" she asks .
" H ow does what end? "
"After

a com panion, how does it go? I can't re member. I never was very

good at Japanese."
" ' I n l i fe , compassion : " I say.
" ' I n trave l i ng, a companion, i n l i fe , compass ion : " she repeats , making
sure of it. If she had paper and penc i l , it wouldn't surprise m e i f she wrote it
down . " S o what does that really mean? I n simple terms."
I th ink i t over. I t takes me a wh i l e to gather my th o ughts , but she wa its
pati e n tly.
"I th ink it means," I say, "that chance encounters are what keep us going.
In simple te rms."
She mulls that over for a wh i l e , th en sl owly brings h e r hands togeth e r on

2 1

top of the table and rests th em th ere l i ghtly. " I th ink you 're right about that ­
that chance encou nters keep us going."
I glance at my watch. It's five-th i rty already. " Maybe we better be getting
back."
"Yeah, I guess so. Let's go," she says, making no move , th ough , to get up.
"By the way, where are we?" I ask.
" I have no idea," she says. She cranes her neck and sweeps the place with
h e r eyes. Her earrings j iggle back and forth l ike two precarious pieces of ripe
fru i t ready to fal l. " From th e time I ' m guess ing we're near Kuras h i k i , not that
it matters. A rest a rea on a h ighway is j ust a place you pass through. To get
from here to there." She holds up her right i ndex fi nger and her left index
finger, about twelve inches apart.
"What does i t matter what it's called?" she continues. "You 've got your
restrooms and your food. Your fluorescent l i ghts and you r plastic c h a i rs.
C rappy coffee. S trawberry- j am sandwiches. It's a l l pointless - assuming you
try to find a poi nt to it. We 're coming from somewhere, heading somewh e re
else.That's all you need to kn ow, right?"
I nod.And nod.And nod.

Wh en we get back to the bus the other passengers are al ready aboard, with
j ust us holding th i ngs up. The driver's a young guy with th i s i ntense look that
reminds me of some stern watchman. H e turns a reproachfu l gaze on the two
of us but doesn't say anyth ing, and the girl sh oots h i m an i n nocent sorry­
we 're-late smile. He reaches out to push a lever and th e door h i sses c l osed.
The girl l ugs her l i ttle suitcase over and sits down beside me - a noth i n g k i n d
of su itcase she must've p icked up at s o m e discount p l a c e - and I pick i t up for
h e r and store it away in the overhead rack. Pretty heavy for its size. S h e thanks
me, the n recl ines her seat and fades off to sleep. Like it can barely wait to get
going, the bus sta rts to roll the i nstant we get settl ed. I pull out my paperback
and p i ck up where I 'd left off.
The girl's soon fast asleep, and as the bus sways through each c u rve h e r
head leans aga i nst my shoulder, fi nally c o m i n g t o a r e s t there. Mouth closed,
she's breath ing qui etly through her nose, the breath graz i n g my shoulder at
regular beats. I look down and catch a gl impse of h e r bra strap through th e
collar of her crewneck s h i rt, a th i n , cream-colored strap. I p i cture th e d e l i cate
fabric at th e end of that strap. The soft breasts beneath.The p i nk nipples taut
under my fi ngertips. Not that I ' m trying to i magine all th is, but I can't h e l p i t.

22

And - no surprise - I get a mass ive hard-on. So rigid it makes me wonder h ow
any part of your body could ever get so rock hard.
Just th e n a thought h i ts m e . Maybe - j ust maybe - th i s girl's my s i ster.
S h e 's about the right age . Her odd looks aren't at all l ike the g i rl in the photo ,
b u t you can't a lways count on that. Depending on how they're taken people
sometimes look totally different. She said she has a broth e r my age who she
hasn't seen i n ages . Couldn't that brother be

me

- i n theory, at l east?

I stare at her chest. As she breathes, the rounded peaks move up and
down l ike the swell of waves, somehow reminding me of ra i n fal l i n g softly on
a broad stretch of sea . I ' m the lonely voyager standing on deck, and she's the
sea. The sky i s a blanket of gray, merging with the gray sea off on the horizon .
I t's hard to tel l the difference betwee n sea and sky. B etwee n voyager and sea.
B etwee n real ity and the workings of the heart.
The girl wears nv o ri ngs on her fingers , neither of wh i c h i s a wedding or
engagement ring, j ust cheap th i ngs you find at th ose l i ttle boutiques girls
shop at. Her fi n ge rs are long and th i n but look strong, th e nails are short and
n i c ely tri mmed with a l ight pink pol ish. Her hands are resti n g l ightly on the
knees thrust out from her miniskirt. I want to touch those hands, but of cour s e
I d o n ' t . Asleep, she l ooks l ike a young c h i l d . One pointy ear peeks out from
the strands of h a i r l ike a l i ttle mush room, looking strangely fragi l e .
I s h u t m y book and look for a wh ile a t the passi n g scenery. B u t very soo n ,
before I realize it, I fal l asleep myself.

u.s. ARMY INTELLIGENCE SECTION (MIS) REPORT

Dated: May 12, 1946
Title: Report on the Rice Bowl Hill Incident, 1944
Document Number: PTYX-722-8936745-42216-WWN

T

he following is a taped interview with Doctor Juichi Nakazawa (53),
who ran an internal medicine clinic in [name deleted] Town at the
time of the incident. Materials related to the interview can be

accessed using application number PTYX-722-SQ-162 to 183.

Impressions of the interviewer Lt. Robert O'Connor: Doctor Nakazawa is
so big boned and dark skinned he looks more like a farm foreman than a
doctor. He has a calm manner but is very brisk and concise and says
exactly what's on his mind. Behind his glasses his eyes have a very sharp,
alert look, and his memory seems reliable.

That's correct - at el even a . m . on November 7, 1944, I received a phone
call from the assistant principal at the local elementary schoo! . I used to be
the school doctor, or someth i ng close to it, so that's why they contacted
me fi rst.
The assistant principal was terribly upset. H e told me that a n entire class
had lost consciousness wh ile on an outing i n the hills to p i ck mushrooms.
According to him they were totally unconscious. Only the teacher i n charge
had rema ined conscious, and she'd

back to school for help j ust th e n . S h e

w a s so flustered I couldn't grasp the whole situatio n , th ough one fact d i d
c o m e through l o u d and clear: sixteen c h i ldren h a d col lapsed i n the woods.
The kids were out picking mushrooms, so of course my fi rst thought was

that they'd eaten some poisonous ones and been paralyzed. If that were th e
case it'd be difficult to treat. D i fferent varieties of mushrooms have different
toxicity levels, and the treatments vary. The most we could do at the moment
would be to pump out thei r stomachs. I n the case of h ighly tox i c varieties,
though , the poison might enter the bloodstream qui ckly and we might be too
late . Around here, several people a year die from poison mush room s .
I stuffed some emergency medic i n e i n m y b a g and r o d e my bike over to
the school as fast as I could. The pol ice had been contacted and two poli ce­
men were already the re . We knew we had to get th e unconscious kids back to
town and would need all the help we could get. Most of the young men were
away at war, th ough , so we set off with the best we had - myself, the two
pol i c e m e n , an elderly male teacher, the assistant principal a n d principal ,
the school j a n i tor. And of course the homeroom teacher who'd b e e n with the
kids. We grabbed whatever b i cycles we could find, but the re weren 't enough ,
s o some o f us rode two to a bike.
- What time did you arrive at the site?
It was 11:55. I remember since I happened to glance at my watch when
we got th ere. We rode our b i cycles to the bottom of the h i l l , as far as we could
go, the n c l i mbed the rest of the way on foot.
By the time I a rrived several c h i ldren had partially rega i ned conscious­
ness. Three or fou r of them, as I recall . But they were n 't fully conscious - sort
of dizzily on all fours. The rest of th e chi ldren were stil l collapsed. After a
wh i l e some of the oth ers began to come around, th eir bodies u n d ulating l ike
so many big worms. It was a very strange sight. The c h i ldren had collapsed i n
a n odd, Rat, open space i n the woods where it l ooked l ike a l l the trees had
been neatly remove d , with autumn sunl ight shining down brigh tly. And h e re
you had, in th i s spot or at the edges of it, s ixteen elementary-school kids scat­
tered about prostrate on the grou nd, some of them starti n g to move , some of
th em compl etely sti l l . The whole th ing reminded me of some weird avant­
garde play.
For a moment I forgot that I was supposed to treat the kids and j ust stood
th ere, frozen, staring at the scene. Not j ust myself- everyon e i n the resc u e
group reacted t h e same, paralyzed for a wh i l e b y w h a t they saw. Th i s m i g h t be
a strange way of putti ng it, perhaps, but it was l ike some m istake had o c c u rred
that allowed u s to see a s ight people should never see. I t was wart i m e , and I
was always mentally prepared, as a physician, to deal with whatever c a m e , i n
the remote poss i b i l ity that someth i ng awful wou ld occm way out h ere i n th e

country. Prepared as a citizen of J apan to calmly do my duty if the need arose .
But when I saw th i s scene in the woods I l i terally froze.
I soon snapped out of it, and picked up one of the c h i ldren, a l i ttle girl .
H e r body had no strength in it at all and was l i mp as a rag dol l . Her breath i n g
w a s steady b u t she w a s s t i l l unconscious. Her eyes, though , were o p e n , track­
ing someth i n g back and forth . I pulled a small flash l i gh t out of my bag and
s h i ned it o n her pupils. Compl etely unreactive . H e r eyes were fu nctioning,
watc h i n g someth i ng, yet showed no response to l ight. I p i cked up several
oth e r c h i l d ren and examined th em and they were all exactly th e same, u nre­
spons ive . I found th i s quite odd.
I next checked th eir pulse and temperature. Th e i r pulses were betwee n
5 0 and 55, and all of th em h a d temperatures j ust below 9 7 degrees. Some­

where around 96 degrees or thereabouts, as I reca l l . That's correct - for c h il­
dren of that age th i s pulse rate is well below normal , the body temperature
over one degree below average . I smelled their breath , but th ere was noth i n g
o u t of t h e ordinary. Likewise with their throats and tongues.
I immediately ascerta ined these weren't the symptoms of food poisoning.
Nobody had vomited or suffered diarrhea, and none of them seemed to be in
any pa i n . I f the c h i ldren had eaten someth ing bad you could expect - wi th
th i s much time having elapsed - the onset of at least one of these symptoms.
I heaved a s i gh of relief that it wasn't food poisoning. B u t th e n I was stumped,
s i n c e I hadn't a clue what was wrong with th em.
The symptoms were similar to sunstroke . Kids often collapse from th i s in
the summer. I t's l ike it's contagious - once one of th e m collapses th e i r friends
a l l do the same, one after the other. But th i s was November, i n a cool woods,
n o less. One or two getting sunstroke i s one th ing, but s ixteen c h ildren s i mul­
taneously coming down with it was out of the questio n .
My n ext thought was some kind of poison gas or n e rve gas , either natu­
rally occurring or man-made. But how i n the world could gas appear in the
middle of the woods i n such a remote part of th e country? I couldn't account
for it. Poison gas , though , would logically expl a i n what I saw that day. Eve ry­
one breathed it i n , went unconscious, and collapsed on the spot. The home­
room teacher didn't collapse because the concentration of gas wasn't strong
enough to affect an adult.
But wh en it came to treating the c h i ldre n , I was totally lost. I'm j ust a
simple country doctor and have no special expertise i n poison gasses, so I was
out of my leagu e . We were out i n th is remote town and I couldn't very well
ring up a spec i a l i st. Very gradually, i n fact, some of the c h i ldren were getting
better, and I figured that perhaps with time they would all rega i n conscious-

ness. I know it's an overly opti mistic vi ew, but at the ti m e I couldn't th ink of
anyth i n g else to do. So I suggested that we j ust let th e m l i e there quietly for a
wh i l e a n d see what developed.
- Was there anything unusual in the air?
I was concerned about that myself, so I took several deep b reaths to see if
I could detect any u nusual odor. But it was j ust the ordi n a ry smell of a woods
i n the h i ll s . I t was a bracing scent, the fragrance of trees. Noth i ng unusual
about the pla nts and flowers around th ere, either. Noth i ng had cha nged
shape or been discolored.
One by o n e I exa m i ned the mushrooms the c h i l dren had been picking.
There were n ' t a l l that m any, wh ich led m e to conclude that they'd c o l lapsed
not long after they began picking the m . All of them were typ i c a l edible mush­
rooms. I 've been a doctor here for some time and a m qu i te fa m i l i a r with the
different vari eti es. Of course to be on the safe side I collected th e m all and
took the m back and had a special ist examine th e m . But as far as I could tel l ,
they were a l l ordi nary, edible mushrooms.
- You said the unconscious children's eyes moved back and forth, but
did you notice any other unusual symptoms or reactions? For instance, the
size of their pupils, the color of the whites of their eyes, the frequency of
their blinking?
N o . Oth e r than the i r eyes m oving back and forth l ike a search l i ght, th e re
was noth i n g out of the ordinary. Al l other fu nctions were completely norm a l .
T h e c h ildren were looking at someth i ng. To p u t a fi n e r p o i n t o n it, th e ch il­
dren weren't looking at what we could see, but someth i n g we
more l ike th ey were

couldn't. I t was
observing someth i n g rather than j ust looking at it. They

were essentially expressionless, but overall they seemed cal m , not afra i d or in
any pa i n . That's also one of the reasons I decided to j ust let th e m lie there and
see how th i n gs played out. I decided if they're not i n any pa i n , th e n j ust let
them be for a wh i l e .
- Did anyone mention the idea that the children had been gassed?
Yes , they d i d . B u t l ike me they couldn't figure out h ow it was poss i b l e . I
m ea n , no one had ever heard of som ebody goi n g on a h ike i n the woods
and ending lip getting gassed. Then one of the people there - the assistant

principal , I bel i eve it was - said it might have been gas dropped by the
America ns. They must have dropped a bomb with poison gas, he s a i d. The
homeroom teacher recalled seeing what looked l ike a B-29 i n the sky j ust
before they started up the hill, flying right overhead. That's i t! everyon e s a i d ,
some new poison g a s b o m b t h e Americans developed. Rumors a b o u t the
Ame ricans developing a new kind of bomb had even reached our neck of the
woods. But why would the Am ericans drop th eir newest weapon in such an
out-of-the-way place? That we couldn't explain. But m istakes are part of l i fe ,
a n d some th i ngs w e aren 't meant to understand, I suppose.
- After this, then, the children gradually recovered on their own?
They did. I can't tell you how reli eved I was. At fi rst th ey started squ i rm­
ing around, th en they sat up unsteadily, gradually rega i ni n g consciousness.
No one compla i n e d of a ny pain during th is process. It was all ve ry qu i et, l ike
they were waking up from a deep sleep. And as they regained consci ous­
ness th eir eye movements became normal aga i n. They showed normal reac­
tions to l ight when I s h i n ed a flashlight in the i r eyes. It took some time,
th ough , for th em to be able to speak aga i n - j ust l ike you are when you fi rst
wake up.
We asked each of the children what had happened, but they looked
du mbfounded, l ike we were asking about someth i n g they didn't remember
taking place. Going up the hill, starting to gath er mushrooms - that much
they recalled. Everyth i n g after that was a total bla nk. They had n o sense of
any time pass ing betwee n th en and now. They start gathering mushroom s ,
th en t h e c u rtain fal l s , and h e r e they a r e l y i n g on t h e ground, surrounded b y
all these adults.T h e c h i ldren couldn't figure out w h y we w e r e all upset, star­
i n g at th em with these worried looks on our faces. They seemed more afra i d
of us than anyth ing else.
Sadly, there was one child, a boy, who di dn't rega i n consciousness. One
of the c h i ldren evacuated from Tokyo. Satoru Nakata, I bel i eve h i s n a m e was.
A small , pale l i ttle boy. He was the only one who rema i n ed unconsci ous. H e
j ust l a y th ere on t h e ground, his eyes moving back a n d forth.We had t o carry
h i m back down the h i l l. The other children walked back down l ike noth i n g
h a d happened.
- Other than this boy, Nakata, none of the other children showed any
symptoms later on?

As far as any outward s i gns at least, no, they displayed no u nusual symp­
toms. N o one complained of pain or discomfort. As soon as we got back to the
sch ool I brought the c h i l dren i nto th e nurse's room one by one and exa m i n e d
th em - took the i r temperature , l i stened t o their heart with a stethoscope ,
ch ecked th e i r vision . Whatever I was able to do at the time I d i d . I had th em
solve some s i mple arithmetic problems, stand o n one foot with thei r eyes
cl osed, th i ngs l ike that. Phys i cally they were fi n e . They didn't seem ti red and
had healthy appetites. They'd missed lunch so they all said they were h u ngry.
We gave them rice balls to eat, and they gobbled them up.
A few days l ater I stopped by th e school to observe how the c h i ldren were
doing. I called a few of them i nto the nurse's room and questioned the m .
Aga i n , though , everyth ing seemed fi n e . No traces rema i n e d , physically or
emotionally, from th eir strange experience. They couldn't even remember
that i t had happen e d . Their l ives were compl etely back to normal, unaffected
by the incident. They attended class as usual , sang songs, played outs i d e d u r­
ing recess, eve ryth i n g normal kids did. Their homeroom teacher, howeve r,
was a different story : she sti ll seemed in shock.
But that one boy, Nakata , didn't rega i n consciousness, so the following
day he was taken to th e un ivers ity hospital i n Kofu . After that h e was trans­
ferred to a m i l i ta ry h ospital , and never came back to our town aga i n . I never
heard what became of h i m .
Th i s incident n ever made the newspapers. M y guess i s t h e authorities
decided it would only cause u n rest, so they banned any mention of it. You
have to remember that dur i ng the war the m i l i ta ry tri ed to squelch whatever
they saw as groundl ess ru mors. The war wasn't goi ng well , with the m i l i ta ry
retreating on the southern front, suicide attacks one after the other, a i r ra ids
on cities getting worse all the ti me. The mil itary was especially afra id of
any antiwar o r pacifist sentiment cropping up among the popu l a c e . A few
days afte r th e i n c ident the pol ice came call i n g and warned us that under n o
c i rcumstances were we t o t a l k about what we'd s e e n .
T h e w h o l e th i n g w a s an odd, unpleasant affa i r. E v e n t o th is day it's l ike a
weight press i n g down on me.

Chapter 5

I

' m asleep when our bus drives across the huge new bridge over the Inland
Sea. I 'd seen the bridge only on maps and had been looking forward
to seeing it for real. Somebody gently taps me on the shoulde r and I

wake up.
" Hey, we're here ," the girl says.
I stretc h , rub my eyes with the back of my hand, and look out the w i n­
dow. Sure enough , the bus is j ust pulling i nto what l ooks l i ke the square i n
front of a stati on. Fresh morning sunlight l ights u p the scene. Almost b l i n d­
ing, but gentle somehow, the l ight is different from what I was u se d to i n
Tokyo. I glance a t m y watch. 6:32.
"Gosh, what a long trip," she says tiredly. "I thought my l ower back was
goi n g to give out.And my neck's killing me.You aren't going to catch me o n
an a ll-night bus aga i n. I ' m taking the plane from n o w on, eve n i f i t's more
expensive. Turbulence , h i j ackings - I don't care. Give me a plane any day."
I l ower her s u i tcase and my backpack from the ove rhead rack. "What's
your name ? " I ask.
"My name ? "
"Yeah."
" Sakura," she says. "What about you ? "
" Kafka Ta mur a , " I reply.
" Kafka Tamura ," she muses. "Weird name. E asy to remember, though."
I nod. Becoming a different person might be hard, but taking on a diffe rent name is a cinch.
She gets off the bus, sets her suitcase on the ground, and plunks herself
down on top , then pulls a notebook from a pocket i n he r small backpack,
scribbles down someth i ng, rips the page out, and hands it to me. A phone
number, by the l ooks of it.
"My cel l phone number," she says with a wry expression. 'T m staying at
my friend's place for a wh i le , but if you ever feel l ike seeing somebody, give

me a c a l l . We can go out for a bite or whatever. Don't be a stranger, okay?
' Even chance meetings' . . . how does the rest of that go?"
" 'Are the result of karma.' "
" Right, right," she says . " B u t what does it mean?"
"That th i n gs i n l ife are fated by our previous l ives . That even i n the small­
est events there's no such th ing as coincidence."
S h e sits there on her yell ow suitcase, notebook i n hand, giving i t some
thought. "Hmm . . . that's a kind of phi losophy, isn't it. Not such a bad way of
th inking about l i fe . Sort of a rei ncarnati on, New Age k i n d of th ing. But,
Kafka , remember th i s , okay? I don't go around giving my c e l l phone number
to j ust a nybody. You know what I mean?"
I appreciate it, I tel l her. I fold up the piece of paper and stick it i n the
pocket of my w i n dbreaker. Thinking better of it, I transfer i t to my wallet.
" S o how long'll you be i n Takamatsu?" Sakura asks .
" I don't know yet," I say. " I t depends on how th i n gs go."
S h e gazes i ntently at m e , her head tilted slightly to one side. Okay, what­
ever, she might be th inking. She c l i mbs i nto a cab, gives a l i ttle wave , and
takes off.
Once aga i n I ' m all alone.

Sakura, I th ink - not my s i ster's n a m e . But

names are changed easily enough . Especially wh e n you 're trying to try to run
away from somebody.
I have a reservation at a busi ness hotel i n Takamats u . The YMCA in
Tokyo had told me about the place, and through th em I got a discount o n the
roo m . But that's only for the fi rst th ree days , then i t goes back to the normal
room rate .
If I really wanted to save money, I could j ust sack out on a bench in front
of the statio n , or since it's still warm out, I could sleep i n my sleeping bag in
a park somewhere. But then th e cops will come and card me - th e one th i n g
I have t o avoi d at all costs. That's w h y I went for t h e hotel reservati o n , at least
for th ree days . Afte r that I'll figure someth ing out.
At the stati o n I pop into th e fi rst l i ttl e diner that catches my eye , and eat
my fi l l of udon. Born and ra ised i n Tokyo , I haven't had much udon i n my
l i fe . But now I ' m i n Udon C entral- Sh ikoku - and confronted with noodles
l ike noth ing I 've ever seen. They're chewy and fresh, and the soup smells
great, really fragrant. And talk about cheap. I t all tastes so good I order sec­
ond s , and for the fi rst time i n who knows how long, I'm happily stuffed. After­
ward I plop myself down on a bench in the plaza next to the station and gaze
up at the sunny sky.

I 'm free, I remind myself. Like the clouds floating ac ross

the sky, I'm all by myself, total ly fre e .

I decide to k i l l time till evening at a l ibrary. Ever s i n c e I was l i ttle I 've l oved to
spend time in the reading rooms of l ibraries, so I 've come to Takamatsu
armed with info on all the l ibraries in and around the city. Th ink about it � a
l i ttle kid who doesn't want to go home doesn't have many places h e

can go.

C offee shops and movie th eaters are off-l i mits . That l eaves only l i braries, and
they're perfect � no entrance fee, nobody getting all hot and bothered i f a kid
comes in. You j ust sit down and read whatever you want. I always rode my
b ike to the local publ i c l ibrary after school . Even on h o l i days that's where
you'd fi n d me. I 'd devour anyth ing and everyth i n g � novels, b i ograp h i e s , h i s­
tories, whateve r was lying around. Once I 'd gone through all the c h i l d re n 's
books , I went on to the general stacks and books for adults . I might not always
get much out of the m , but I forged on to the very last page . When I got tired
of reading I 'd go i nto one of those l istening booths with headphones and
e n j oy some mus i c . I had no idea about mus ic so I j ust went down the row of
C Ds they had th ere, giving th em all a l iste n . That's how I got to know about
Duke E l l i ngton, the Beatles, and Led Zeppel i n .
T h e l ibrary was l ike a second home. Or maybe more l ike a real h o m e ,
more than t h e place I l ived i n . B y goi ng every d a y I got t o know all t h e lady
l ibrarians who worked th ere. They knew my name and always said h i . I was
painfully shy, th ough , and could barely reply.
Before coming to Takamatsu I found out some wealthy man from an old
family i n the suburbs had renovated his personal l ibrary i nto a private l ibra ry
open to the publ i c . The place has a lot of rare books , and I heard that the
b u ilding itself and the surrounding garden were worth checking out. I saw a
photo of the place once in

Taiya magaz i n e . It's a large , Japanese-style house

with th i s really elegant reading room that looks more l ike a parlor, where
people are s i tting with th eir books on comfortabl e-l ooking sofas. For some
reason that photo really stayed with me, and I wanted to see th i s i n person i f
someday th e c h a n c e came along. T h e Komura M e m o r i a l Library, t h e place
was called.
I go over to the tourist information booth at the station and ask how to get
th ere. A pleasant middle-aged lady marks the spot on a tourist map and gives
me i n stru ctions on wh ich tra i n to take . It's about a twenty- m i nute ride, she
expl a i n s . I thank her and study the schedule posted inside the stati o n . Tra i n s
ru n a b o u t every twenty minutes. I have s o m e time, so I p i ck up a takeout
lunch at one of th e l i ttle shops.

The tra i n is j ust two l i ttle cars coupled togeth er. The tracks cut through a
h i gh-ri se shopp ing district, th en past a mix of small shops and houses, facto­
ries and wareh ouses. N ext comes a park and an apartment b u i l di n g under
constructi o n . I press my face aga i nst the window, drinking i n the u n fa m i l i a r
s i ghts . I 've h a rdly ever b e e n outside of Tokyo , and everyth i n g l ooks fresh and
new. The tra i n I ' m o n , going out of town , i s nearly empty th i s time of th e
morning, but the platforms on the other side are packed with j u n i o r and se­
nior h igh school kids i n summer uniforms, schoolbags slung a c ross their
shoulders. All heading to schoo! . Not m e , though . I ' m a l o n e , goi ng i n the
oppos ite directi o n . We 're on different tracks i n more ways than o n e . All of a
sudden the a i r feels th i n and something heavy is bearing down on my chest.
Am I really doing the right th i ng? The thought makes me feel helpless, i so­
lated. I turn my back on the schoolkids and try not to look at th e m anymore .
The tra i n ru ns along th e sea for a time, th e n cuts i n l a n d . We pass tall
fields of corn , grapevines, tangerine trees growing on terraced h i l l s . An occa­
s i onal i rrigation pond sparkl es in th e sunl ight. A river winding through a flat
stretc h of land l ooks cool and inviting, an empty lot i s overgrown with sum­
mer grasses. At one point we pass a dog standing by the tracks , sta r i n g vacantly
at th e tra i n rus h i n g by. Watch i ng th i s scenery makes me feel warm and calm
all over aga i n .

You 're going to be okay, I tell myself, taki n g a deep breath . All

you can do i s forge on ahead .
At the station I fol l ow the map and walk n orth past rows of old stores and
houses. B oth sides of the street are l i ned with walls around peopl e 's homes.
I 've n ever seen so many different kinds - black walls made out of boards,
wh ite wal l s , granite block wal ls, stone wal l s with hedges on top. The whole
place i s sti l l and s i lent, with no one else on th e street. Hardly any cars pass by.
The a i r smells l ike the sea, wh ich must be nearby. I l i sten ca refully but can't
hear any waves. Fa r off, though , I hear the fa int bee-like buzz of an electr i c
saw, maybe from a construction s i t e . S m a l l signs with arrows p o i n t i n g toward
the l i brary l i n e the road from the station, so I can't get lost.
Right i n front of the Komura Memorial Library's imposing front gate
stand two n eatly tri mmed plum trees. Inside the gate a gravel path winds past
other beautifu l ly manicured bushes and trees - pines and magn o l i as , kerria
and azaleas - with not a fallen leaf i n sight. A couple of stone lanterns peek
out between the trees, as does a small pond. Finally I get to the i ntricately
designed entra n c e . I come to a halt i n front of the open front door, hesitating
for a moment about going inside. Th i s place doesn't look l ike any l i b ra ry I 've
ever seen. But having come all th is way I might as well take th e plunge. Just

i n s i d e th e entrance a young man is sitting behind a counter where you check
you r bags . I slough off my backpack, th en take off my sunglasses and cap.
"Is th is your fi rst visit?" he asks me i n a relaxed, qu iet voi c e . It's s l i ghtly
h i gh-p itched, but smooth and sooth ing.
I nod, but the words don't come. The questi on takes me by surprise and
makes me kind of te nse.
A long, freshly sharpened pencil between h i s fi ngers, the young man
gazes i ntently at my face for a wh i l e . The pencil i s yel l ow, with a n eraser at
the end. The man's face i s on the small side, h i s features regular. Pretty,
rath er than handsom e , might describe h i m best. H e 's wearing a button-down
wh ite cotton s h i rt and ol ive green chinos, with not a s i ngle wrinkle o n eith e r.
When he looks down h i s longish hair falls over h i s brow, and occasionally h e
notices th i s and fi ngers it back. H i s sleeves a r e rolled up t o th e elbows, reveal­
ing slender wh ite wrists . Del icately framed glasses n i c ely complement h i s
features . T h e small plastic n a m e tag p i n ned t o h i s chest says

Oshima . N o t

exactly t h e type of l ibrarian I ' m used to .
" Feel free to use the stacks," he tells me, "and if you find a book you'd l ike
to read, j ust bring it to th e reading room . Rare books have a red seal on th e m ,
and for those you ' l l n e e d t o fill o u t a request c a r d . Over there t o t h e right i s
t h e reference room . Th ere's a card index a n d a computer y o u can u s e to
search for material . We don't allow any books to be c hecked out. We don't
carry any magaz ines or newspapers. No cameras are allowed . And neither i s
m a k i n g c o p i e s of anyth ing. A l l food a n d beverages s h o u l d be c o n s u m e d out­
s i d e on the benches. And we close at five." He lays h i s pencil on the desk and
adds, "Are you i n h igh school ?"
"Yes, I a m ," I say after taking a deep breath .
"Th i s l i b rary is a l i ttle different from the ones you 're probably used to," h e
says . "We specialize i n ce rta in genres o f books, mainly o l d books b y tanka a n d
haiku poets . Natu ral ly, w e have a selection o f general books as wel l . Most o f
t h e people w h o r i d e the tra i n a l l the way o u t here a r e doing research i n th ose
fields. No one comes here to read the latest Steph en King nove l . We might
get the occasional graduate student, but very seldom someone your age. So ­
are you researc h i n g tanka or ha iku , then?"
" N o ," I answer.
"That's what I thought."
"I s it stil l okay for me to lise the l ibrary?" I ask timi dly, trying to keep my
voi ce from cracking.
"Of cour se . " H e smiles and places both hands on the desk. "Th i s i s a

34

l i b rary, and a nybody who wants to read is welcome. Th i s can be our l i ttle
secret, but I'm not parti cularly fond of tanka or ha iku myself."
" I t's a really beautiful b u i l di ng," I say.
He nods. 'The Komura fa mi ly's been a m a j o r sake produ c e r s i n c e the
Edo period," h e expl a i n s , "and t h e previ ous h e a d of t h e family w a s qu i te a
b i b l i oph i l e , nationally fa mous for scouring the country in search of books.
H i s fathe r was h i mself a tanka poet, and many writers used to stop by h e re
when they came to S h i koku. Wakayama B okus u i , for insta n c e , or Ishikawa
Takuboku , and S h iga Naoya. Some of th em must have found it quite com­
fortable here, because they stayed a long time. All in a l l , the family spared n o
expense w h e n it came t o t h e l i terary arts. What usually happens with a family
l ike that i s eventually a descendant squa nders the inheritance, but fortu­
nately the Komuras avoided that fate. They e n j oyed thei r h obby, in i ts place,
but made sure the family busi ness did well."
"So th ey were r i c h ," I say, stati ng the obvi ous.
"Very much so." H i s l i ps cmve eve r so slightly. "They aren't as rich n ow
as th ey were before the war, but they're still pretty wealthy. Wh i c h is why they
can m a i n t a i n such a wonde rful l ibrary. Of comse making it a foundation
helps l ower the i r i n h eritance tax, but that's another story. I f you 're really
interested i n th i s b u i l ding I suggest you take the l i ttle tom at two. I t's only
once a week, o n Tuesdays , wh ich happens to be today. There's a rath e r
uniqu e c o l l e c t i o n of pai ntings and d rawings on t h e s e c o n d floor, and the
building itsel f is, arc h i tectmally, quite fascinating. I know you ' l l e n j oy it."
"Thank you ," I say.
You 're quite welcome, h i s smile suggests . He p icks h i s pencil up aga i n
a n d starts tapp i n g the eraser e n d on the desk l ike h e 's gently encouraging m e .
"Are y o u t h e o n e w h o does the tour?"
Osh ima smiles. " N o , I ' m j ust a lowly assistant, I ' m afra i d. A lady named
M iss Saeki i s i n charge here - my boss. She's related to the Komuras and does
th e tour h e rself. I know you 'll l ike her. She's a wonderful person ."
I go i nto the h igh-c e i l inged stacks and wander among the shelves, search­
ing for a book that looks i nte resting. Magnificent th ick beams ru n a c ross th e
c e i l i n g of the room , and gentle early-summer s u n l i ght is s h i n i n g th rough
th e open window, the chatter of b i rds i n the garden filtering i n . The books i n
th e shelves i n front of m e , sure enough , are just l ike Osh ima s a i d , m a i n ly
books of Japanese poetry. Tank a and haiku, essays on poetry, b i ograph i e s of
various poets . There are also a lot of books on local h istory. A shelf farth e r
back conta i n s general humanities - collections of Japanese l i te rature , world

35

l i terature , and i ndividual writers, class ics, phil osophy, drama , art h istory, soci­
ology, h istory, b i ography, geography . . . . When I ope n the m , most of the
books have the smell of an earlier time leaking out between the pages - a
special odor of the knowledge and emotions that for ages have been calmly
resti ng betwee n the covers. B reath ing it i n , I glance through a few pages
before retu rning each book to its shelf.
Finally I decide on a multivolume set, with beautiful covers, of the B ur­
ton translation of The Arabian

Nights, pick out one vol ume , and take i t back

to the reading roo m . I 've been meaning to read th i s book. S i n ce the l ibrary
has j ust opened for the day, there's no one else there and I have the e legant
reading room all to myself. It's exactly like i n the photo i n the maga z i ne ­
roomy and comfortable , with a high cei l i ng. Every once in a wh i le a gentle
breeze blows in through the open window, the wh ite c u rt a i n rustl i n g softly i n
a i r that h a s a h i nt o f the sea . And I love the comfortable sofa . A n o l d upright
piano stands i n a corner, and the whole place makes me feel l i ke I'm i n some
friend's home .
A s I relax o n the sofa a n d gaze around the room a thought h i ts me : Th i s
i s exactly the place I 've been looking for forever. A l i ttle h i deaway i n some
s i nkhole somewhere . I 'd always thought of it as a sec ret, imaginary place , and
can barely bel ieve that it actually exists. I close my eyes and take a breath , and
l ike a gentle cloud the wonder of it all settles over me . I slowly stroke the
c reamish cover of the sofa, then stand up and walk over to the p i a n o and l i ft
the cover, laying all ten finge rs down o n the slightly yel lowed keys . I s h u t the
cover and walk across the faded grape-patterned ca rpet to the window and test
the anti que handle that opens and closes it. I switch the floor lamp on and
off, then check out all the pai nti ngs hanging on the wal l s . Finally I plop
back down on the sofa and pick up reading where I left off , focusing on

The

Arabian Nights for a wh i le .
A t noon I take m y bottle o f mine ral water a n d box l u n c h o u t t o the
veranda that faces the garden and sit down to eat. Different kinds of b i rds fly
overhead, fluttering from one tree to the next or flying down to the pond to
drink and groom themselves. There are some I 've never seen before . A large
b rown cat makes an appearance , wh ich is the i r s ignal to c lear out of there ,
even though the c a t looks like he couldn't care less about b i rds. Al l h e wants
is to stretch Ollt on the stepping stones and e n j oy the warm sunl ight.
" I s you r school closed today?" Osh ima asks when I d rop off my backpack
on my way back to the reading room.
" N o ," I reply, carefully choosing my words, " I j ust decided to take some
time off."

" Refusing to go to school ," he says .
" I guess so."
Osh i m a looks at me with great i nterest. "You guess so."
''I'm not refusing to go to school . I j ust decided not to ."
"Very calmly, all o n your own , you stopped goi n g to school ? "
I merely n o d . I have no i d e a how t o reply.
"According to Aristophanes in Plato's

Symposium, in the a n c i e n t world

of myth there were three types of people," Osh ima says . " H ave you heard
about th i s ? "
" N o ."
" I n ancient times people weren't just male or femal e , but o n e of three
types: male/male, male/female, or female/female. I n other word s , each per­
son was made out of the components of m'o peopl e . Everyon e was happy with
th i s arrangement and n ever really gave it much th ought. B u t th en God took a
knife and cut everybody in half, right down the middl e . So after that the
world was divided j ust i n to male and female, the upshot being that people
spend the i r time ru nning around trying to locate th eir missing oth e r half."
"Why did God do that?"
" D ivide people i nto two ? You got me. God works i n mysterious ways .
Th ere 's that whole wrath-of-God th ing, all that excessive idealism a n d so o n .
My guess i s i t w a s punishment for someth i ng. L i k e i n t h e B ibl e . Ada m and
Eve and the Fall and so forth ."
"Original s i n ," I say.
"That's right, original s i n ." Osh ima holds his pencil betwee n h i s middle
and index fingers, twirling it ever so slightly as i f testi ng th e balan c e . "Anyway,
my point is that i t's really hard for people to l ive th e i r l ives alone."
Back i n the readi ng room I return to "The Tale of Abu-I-Hasa n , the
Wag," but my mind wanders away from the book.

Male/male, male/female,

and female/female?

At two o'clock I lay down my book and get up from the sofa to join the tou r of
th e b u i lding. M iss Saek i , leading the tour, is a slim woman I 'd gues s i s i n h e r
mid-forties. S h e 's a l i ttle on t h e t a l l side for someone of h e r generati o n . S h e 's
wearing a blue half-sleeved d ress and a cream-col ored c a rdiga n , and has
excellent posture . Her long h a i r is loosely tied back, her face very refi n e d and
i ntell igent looking, with beautiful eyes and a shadowy smile playi n g over h e r
l ips, a smile w h o s e s e n s e of completeness i s i ndescribabl e . I t r e m i n d s me of a
smal l , sunny spot, th e special patch of sunlight you fi n d only i n some remote,

37

secluded place. My house back in Tokyo has one just l ike that in the gard e n ,
and ever s i n c e I was l i ttle I loved that bright l i ttle spot.
She makes a strong i mpress ion on me, making me feel wistful and nostal­
gic. Wouldn't it be great if th i s were my mother? But I th ink th e same th i n g
every t i m e I r u n across a charming, middle-aged woman . T h e c h a n c e s that
M iss Saeki 's actually my mother are close to zero, I rea l i z e . S ti l l , s i n c e I have
no idea what my mother looks l ike, or even her name, the poss i b i l ity

does

exist, right? Th ere's noth ing that rules it out completely.
The only other people taking the tour are a middle-aged couple fro m
Osaka . T h e wife i s sh ort a n d pudgy with glasses as th ick as a C oke bottl e . T h e
husband's a skinny guy with hair s o stiff I b e t he n e e d s a wire brush t o t a m e i t .
With narrow eyes and a broad forehead , he reminds me of s o m e statue on a
southern island, eyes fixed on the horizon. The wife keeps up a o n e-sided
conversation, her husband j ust grunting out a monosyllable every once i n a
wh i l e to let her know h e 's still al ive . Other than that, he gives th e occasional
nod to show h e 's properly impressed or else mutters some fragmentary com­
ment I can't catc h . Both of them are dressed more for mountain c l i mb i n g
t h a n for visiting a l i b ra ry, e a c h wearing a waterproof vest with a m i l l i o n pock­
ets, sturdy lace-up boots , and hiking hats. Maybe th i s is how they a lways
d ress wh en they go on a trip, who knows . They seem okay - not that I 'd want
th e m as parents or anyth i n g - and I'm rel i eved not to be the only one taking
th e tour.
M i ss Saeki begins by expla i n i ng the library's h istory - basically th e same
story Osh i m a told me. H ow they opened to the publ i c the books and paint­
i n gs the umpteenth head of the family had collected , devoti ng the l i b rary to
th e region's cultural development. A foundation was set up based on the
Komura fortune and now managed the l ibrary and occasionally sponsored
lectures, chamber music concerts , and the l ike. The b u ilding itself dated
from the early Mei j i period, when it was built to serve double duty as the fam­
ily l i b ra ry and guesthouse. I n the Ta isho period it was completely renovated
as a two-story b u ilding, with the addition of magnificent guest rooms for visit­
i n g writers and artists. From the Taisho to the early Showa period, many
famous arti sts visited the Komuras, leaving behind mementos - poems,
sketches, and painti ngs - i n gratitude for having been allowed to stay here.
"You'll be able to view some sel ected items from th i s valuable collection
i n the second-floor gal l e ry," Miss Saeki adds. "Before World War II, a vibrant
local c ulture was establ ished less through the efforts of local government
than those of wealthy connoisseurs such as the Komura fa mily. They were , i n
sh ort, patrons of t h e a rts . Kagawa Prefecture h a s produced quite a number of

talented tanka and haiku poets , and one reason for th i s was the dedication
with wh ich the Komura fa mily founded and supported the local a rt s c e n e .
Quite a n u m b e r of books , essays , and remi niscences have been p u b l i s h e d on
the h istory of these fasci nating artistic circles, all of wh ich are i n o u r readi ng
roo m . I hope you'll take the opportunity to look at the m .
"The heads of t h e Komura family down through th e years have b e e n well
versed i n the a rts, with an especially refined appreciation of the truly excel­
lent. Th i s might have ru n i n the blood. They were ve ry discerning patrons of
the a rts , supporting a rtists with the h i ghest aims who produced the most out­
standing works. But as you 're surely aware , in th e a rts there is no s u c h th i n g as
an absol utely perfect eye . Unfortunately, some exceptional a rtists did not w i n
th eir favor or w e r e not received b y th em as they deserved to be. O n e of these
was the haiku poet Taneda Santoka . According to th e guestbook, Santoka
stayed h e re o n numerous occasions, each time leaving beh i n d poems and
drawi ngs. The head of the fami ly, however, called him a 'beggar a n d a b rag­
gart: wouldn't have much to do with h i m , and in fact threw away most of
these works ."
"What a terrible waste ," the lady from Osaka says , apparently truly sorry
to hear th i s . " Nowadays Santoka fetches a hefty price."
"You 're exactly right," Miss Saeki says , beaming. " B u t at the t i m e , h e was
an unknown , so perhaps it couldn't be helped. There a re many th i n gs we
only see clearly i n retrospect."
"You got that right," the husband pipes i n .
After th i s M iss Saeki guides u s around the fi rst floor, showing us the
stacks , the reading roo m , the rare-books collecti o n .
"When h e b u i l t th is l ibrary, t h e h e a d of t h e fa mily d e c i d e d not t o fol l ow
th e simple and el egant styl e favored by artists in Kyoto , i ns tead choosing a
design more l ike a rustic dwe l l i ng. Sti l l , as you can see, in contrast to the bold
structure of the bu ilding, the fu rnish i ngs and p icture fra mes are q u i te elabo­
rate and l uxur i o u s . The carving of th ese wooden panels, for i n sta n c e , i s very
elegant. All the finest master c raftsmen i n Sh ikoku were assembled to work
on the construction."
Our l i ttle group starts upsta irs, a vaulted ceiling soaring over the sta i r­
case. The ebony ra i l i ng's so h i ghly polished it looks l ike you 'll l eave a mark i f
you touch i t . O n a sta i n ed-gl ass wi ndow next t o th e landing, a deer stretches
out its neck to nibble at some grapes. There are two parlors on the second
floor, as well as a spacious hall that i n the past was probably l i ned with tatami
for banquets and gatherings . Now the floor is plain wood , and the walls a re
covered with framed calligraphy, hanging scrolls, and Japanese-style paintings.

39

I n th e center, a glass case displays various mementos and the story beh i n d
each . O n e parlor i s i n the Japanese style , the other Weste rn . T h e Western­
style room conta ins a large writing desk and a swivel c h a i r that look l ike
someone's sti ll u s i ng. There's a l i n e of pines outside the window b e h i n d the
desk, and the horizon's fa i ntly visible between the trees.
The couple from Osaka walks around the parlor, i nspecti ng all the items,
reading the explanations i n the pamphlet. Every time th e wife makes a com­
ment, the husband ch imes i n to second her opinion. A l u cky couple that
agrees on everyth i ng. The th ings on display don't do much for m e , so I check
out the deta ils of the buildi ng's constructio n . Wh ile I'm nosing around the
Western parlor M i ss Saeki comes up to me and says, "You can sit in that
c h a i r , i f you 'd l ike to. S h iga Naoya and Tanizaki both sat th e re at one time or
a n other. Not that th is i s the same chair, of course."
I sit down on the swivel chair and quietly rest my hands on the desk.
" H ow i s it? Feel l ike you could write someth ing?"
I blush a l i ttle and shake my head. Miss Saeki la ughs and goes back to the
couple. From the chair I watch how she carries herself, every motion natural
and el egant. I can't express it wel l , but th ere's definitely someth i n g

special

about it, as if her retreating figure is trying to tel l me someth ing she couldn't
express wh i l e facing me. But

what th is is, I haven't a clue. Face it, I remind

myself - there're tons of th i ngs you don't have a clue about.
Still seated, I give the room a once-over. On the wall i s an oil pai nting,
apparently of the seashore nearby. It's done i n an old-fashioned styl e , but the
colors are fresh and alive. On top of the desk i s a large ashtray and a lamp with
a green lampshade . I push the switch and, sure enough, the l ight comes o n .
A black clock hangs on the opposite wal l , an antique b y the l ooks of i t , though
the hands tel l the right time. There are round spots worn here and there i n to
the wooden Aoor, and it c reaks sl ightly when you walk on it.
At the end of the tour the Osaka couple th anks M iss Saeki and disap­
pears. It turns out they're members of a tanka circle in th e Kansai regi o n . I
wonder what kind of poems they compose - the husband, especial ly. Grunts
and nods don't add up to poetry. But maybe writing poetry brings out some
h idden talent i n the guy.
I return to the reading room and pick up where I 'd left off in my book.
Over th e afternoon a few other readers filter in, most of them with th ose read­
ing glasses old people wear and that everybody looks the same i n . Time passes
slowly. Nobody says a word , everyone lost i n quiet readi ng. One person sits at
a desk j otting down notes, but the rest are sitting the re s i l ently, not movi ng,
totally absorbed . Just l ike me.

At five o'clock I shut my book and put it back on th e shelf. At th e exit
I ask, "What time do you open i n the morning?"
" E l even ," Osh i m a repl ies. "Planning on coming back tomorrow?"
" I f it's n o bother."
Osh ima n arrows his eyes as he l ooks at me. "Of course not. A l i brary's a
place for people who want to read. I 'd be happy if you came back. I hope you
don't mind my asking, but do you always carry that backpack with you? It
looks pretty h eavy. What i n the world could be inside? A stack of Kruger­
rands, perhaps? "
I blush.
"Don't worry - I ' m not really trying to find out." Osh i m a presses the
eraser end of h i s pencil aga i nst h i s right templ e . "We l l , see you tomorrow."
"Bye ," I say.
I nstead of ra i s i n g his hand, he l i fts his pencil i n fa rewe l l .
I take t h e tra i n back t o Takamatsu Stati o n . For d i n n e r I stop i n s i d e a
cheap diner near the station and order c h i cken cutlet and a salad. I have a
second helping of rice and a glass of warm milk after the meal . At a m i n i-mart
outside I buy a bottl e of mineral water and two rice balls i n case I get h u n gry
in the middle of the night, the n start for my hote l . I walk not too fast or too
slow, at a n ordi nary pace just l ike eve rybody else, so no one notices m e .
T h e hotel i s pretty large, a typical second-rate b u s i ness hote l . I fill i n the
register at the front desk, giving Kafka instead of my real fi rst n a m e , a phony
address and age , and pay for one night. I ' m a l i ttle nervous, but none of the
clerks seem suspicious. Nobody yel l s out, Hey, we can see right through your
nlse, you little fifteen-year-old runaway! Everyth ing goes smooth as silk, busi­
ness as usual .
The elevator clanks omi nously to the sixth Aoor. The room is minuscule,
outfitted with a n u n i nviting bed, a rock-hard pillow, a m i n i ature excuse for a
desk, a tiny TV, sun-bleached c u rta i n s . The bath room is barely the size of
a closet, with none of those l i ttle compl imentary shampoo or conditioner
bottl e s . The view out th e window is of the wall of the building n ext door.
I shouldn't compla i n , though , since I have a roof over my head and hot water
coming out of the tap. I plunk my backpack on th e Aoor, sit down on the
chair, and try to a c c l i matize myself to the surroundings.

I 'm free, I th i nk. I shut my eyes and th ink hard and deep about how free I
a m , but I can't really understand what it means. All I know is I ' m totally
alone. All alone i n an unfa m i l i a r place, l ike some sol ita ry explorer who's lost
h i s compass and h i s map. Is th is what it means to be free? I don't know, and I
give up th inking about it.

I take a long, hot bath and carefully brush my teeth in front of the sink. I
flop down in bed and read, and when I get tired of that I watch the news
on 1V. Compared to everyth ing I 've gone through that day, though , the
news seems stale and boring. I switch off the 1V and get uncler the c overs. I t's
ten p . m . , but I can't get to sleep. A new day in a brand-new place. And my
fifteenth b i rthday, besides - most of wh ich I spent in that charming, offbeat
l i b ra ry. I met a few new peopl e . Sakura . Osh i m a . M iss Saek i . Nobody threat­
ening, thank God. A good omen?
I th ink about my home back in Nogata, i n Tokyo , and my father. H ow
did he feel when he found I 'd suddenly disappeared? Rel i eved, maybe? Con­
fused? Or maybe noth i n g at all . I ' m betting he hasn't even noticed I'm gone .
I suddenly remember m y father's cell phone a n d take i t o u t of my back­
pack. I switch it on and dial my home number. It starts ringing, 450 miles
away, as clearly as if I were calling the room next door. Startled by th i s , I hang
up after two rings . My heart won't stop pounding. The phone still works ,
wh ich means my father hasn't canceled the contract. Maybe he hasn't
noticed the phone's missing from his desk. I sh ove the phone back i n the
pocket of my backpack, turn off th e l ight, and close my eyes. I don't drea m .
C o m e t o th ink o f i t , I haven't h a d any dreams i n a l o n g time.

Chapter 6

H

ello there," the old man called out.
The large, elderly black tomcat ra ised i ts head a fraction and
wearily returned the greeting i n a low voi c e .

" A very n i c e s p e l l of weather we 're havi ng."
" U m ," the cat s a i d .
"Not a cloud i n t h e sky."
" . . . for the time being."
" I s th e weath er going to take a turn for the worse, th e n ? "
" I t feels l ike i t ' l l c l o u d up towa rd evening." T h e b l a c k cat slowly stretched

out a leg, th e n n arrowed its eyes and gave th e old man anoth e r good long
look.
With a big grin on his fac e , the man stared right back. The cat hesitated
for a time, th e n plu nged ahead and spoke . " H m m . . . so you 're able to
speak."
"That's right," the old man said bashful ly. To show his respect, h e took off
h i s threadbare cotton h iking hat. "Not that I can speak to every cat I meet, but
if th i n gs go well I c a n . Like right n ow."
" I nteresting," the cat sa i d s i mply.
"Do you m i n d i f 1 sit down here for a wh i l e ? Nakata's a l i ttle tired from
walking. "
The black cat languidly rose to its feet, wh i skers atwitc h , and yawned so
tremendously its j aw l ooked al most u n h i nged. " I don't mind. O r perhaps 1
should say it's not LIp to me. You can sit anywh ere you l ike. Nobody's goi ng to
bother you for that."
"Thank you k i ndly," the man said, lowering h i mself down beside the cat.
" B oy oh boy, I 've been walking s i n c e six th i s morning."
"Um . . . 1 take it, the n , that you 're Mr. Nakata ? "
"That's right. Nakata 's t h e n a m e . And YOLl would b e ? "

" I forget my name," the cat said. "I had one, I know I did, but somewhere
along th e line I didn't need it anymore . So it's sl ipped my mind."
" I know. I t's easy to forget th i ngs you don't need anymore . Nakata 's
exactly the same way," th e man said, scratching h i s head. " S o what you 're say­
ing, M r. Cat, is that you don't belong to some family somewhere?"
"A long time ago I did. But not anymore . Some fam i l i e s i n the neighbor­
hood give me food to eat now and then, but none of th em own me."
Nakata nodded and was silent for a ti me, then s a i d , "Wo u l d y o u m i n d
ve ry much , then , if I c a l l e d you Otsuka?"
"Otsuka?" the cat said, looking at h i m in surprise. "What are you talking
about? Why do I have to be Otsuka?"
" N o special reason. The name j ust came to me. Nakata j ust p icked one
out of a hat. I t makes th i ngs a lot easier for me i f you have a n a m e . That way
somebody l ike me, who isn't very bright, can organize th i n gs better. For
insta n c e , I can say, On this day of this month I spoke with the black cat Otsuka
in a vacant lot in the 2-chome neighborhood. It helps m e remember."
" I n te resting," the cat said. "Not that I totally fol l ow you . C ats can get by
without names. We go by smel l , shape, th i ngs of th i s natu re . As long as we
know these th i ngs, th ere 're no worries for us."
"Nakata understands completely. But you know, Mr. Otsuka , people
don't work that way. We need dates and names to remember all kinds of
th i ngs ."
The cat gave a snort. " Sounds l ike a pa i n to me."
"You 're absolutely right. There's so much we have to remember, i t

is

a pa i n . Nakata has to remember the name of th e Governor, bus numbers.
Sti l l , you don't mind i f I call you Otsuka? Maybe it's a l i ttle unpl easant
for you ? "
"We l l , n o w that y o u mention i t , I suppose it i s n ' t a l l that pleasant. . . . Not
that it's particularly unpleasant, you understa n d . So I guess I don't really
mind. You want to call me Otsuka, be my guest. I'll admit, though , that i t
doesn't s o u n d right whe n you c a l l me that."
" Nakata's very happy to hear you say that. Thank you so muc h , M r.
Otsuka ."
" I must say that for a human you have an odd way of talking," Otsuka
commented.
"Yes, everybody tells me that. But th i s is the only way Nakata can speak. I
try to talk normally but th i s is what happens. Nakata's not very bright, you s e e .
I wasn't always th is way, b u t w h e n I w a s l i ttl e I w a s i n an a c c i d e n t a n d I 've
been dumb ever s i n c e . Nakata can't write . Or read a book o r a newspaper."

"Not to boast or anyth ing, but I can't write either," the cat s a i d , l i cking
the pads of h i s right paw. 'Td say my mind i s average , though , so I 've n ever
found i t i nconvenient."
"In the cat world that's to be expected," Nakata sa i d . "But i n the human
world i f you can't read or write you 're considered dumb. Nakata's fathe r ­
h e passed away a long time ago - was a famous professor i n a u niversity. H i s
specialty was someth ing called

theery o f fine ants. I have two younger broth­

ers, and they're both very bright. One of th em works at a company, and h e 's a

depart mint ch ief My other brother works at a place called the minis tree of
trade and indus tree. They both l ive in huge houses and eat e e l . Nakata's the
only one who isn't bright."
"But you 're able to talk with cats."
"That's correct," Nakata said.
"Then you 're not so dumb after all."
"Yes. No . . . I mea n , Nakata doesn't really know about that, but ever
s i n c e I was l i ttle people said

You 're dumb, you 're dumb, so I suppose I must be.

I can't read the names of stati ons so I can't buy a ti cket and take a tra i n . I f
I show my

handycap pass, though , they l e t me r i d e t h e city bus."

" I n teresti n g . . . ," Otsuka said without much interest.
"If you can't read or write you can't find a job."
"Then h ow do you make a l iving?"
" I get a

sub city."
"Sub city?"
" T h e Governor gives me money. I l ive i n a l i ttle r o o m i n a n apartment i n
Nogata called t h e

Shoeiso . And I e a t three meals a day."

" S ounds l ike a pretty good l i fe . To me, at least."
"You 're right. It

is a pretty good l i fe . Nakata can keep out of the wind and

ra i n , and I have everyth i n g I need. And sometimes, l ike now, people ask me
to help th em fi n d cats . They give me a present wh en I do. But I 've got to keep
th i s a secret fro m the Governor, so don't tell a nybody. They might cut down
my

sub city i f they find out I have some extra money coming i n . I t's never a

lot, but thanks to it I can eat eel every once in a wh i l e . Nakata l oves eel."
" I l ike eel too . Though I only had it once, a long time ago, and can't
really recall what it tastes l ike ."
"Eel i s qu ite a treat. Th ere's someth i n g different about it, compared to
other food. C e rt a i n foods can take the place of others, but as far as I know,
noth i n g can take the place of eel."
On the road i n front of the empty lot a young man walked by with a l a rge
Labrador retri ever with a red bandanna tied around i ts neck. It glanced over

45

at Otsuka but walked on by. The old man and the cat sat there i n the lot,
s i l ently wa iting for the dog and his master to disappear.
"You said you l ook for cats?" Otsuka asked.
"That's correct. I search for lost cats . I can speak with cats a l i ttl e , so I go
a l l over tracking down ones that have gone missing. People hear that Nakata 's
good at th i s , so they come and ask me to look for the i r lost cats . These days I
spend more days than not out searching for cats. I don't l i ke to go too far away,
so I j ust look for them inside Nakano Ward . Oth e rwise I ' l l be the one l ost and
they'l l be out looking for

me .

"

" S o right n ow you 're searching for a lost cat?"
"Yes, that's correct. Nakata 's looking for a one-year-old tortoiseshell cat
named Coma. H e re 's a ph oto of her." Nakata pulled a color copy out of h i s
canvas shoulder b a g and showed it t o Otsuka. " S he's wearing a b rown fl e a
collar. "
Otsuka stretched out t o gaze at t h e photograph, the n shook h i s head.
" N o , 'fraid I 've n ever

nm

across th i s one. I know most of the cats around

here, but th i s one I don't know. Never seen, or heard, anyth i n g about h e r."
" I s that right? "
" H ave you been looking for her for a long time?"
"We l l , today i s , let me see . . . one, two, th ree . . . the th i rd day."
Otsuka sat there th i nking for a ti me. " I assume you 're aware of th i s , but
cats are c reatures of habit. Usually they l ive very ordered l ives, and u n l ess
someth i n g extraordi nary happens they generally try to keep to the i r routi n e .
What might disrupt th i s is either s e x or an accident - on e of the two . "
" Nakata's th inking t h e s a m e th ing."
"If it's sex, the n you j ust have to wa it till they get i t out of th eir system and
they'll be back. You do understand what I mean by sex?"
"I have n 't done it myself, but I th ink I understan d . I t has to do with your
ween i e , right?"
"That's right. It's all about the weenie." Otsuka nodded, a serious l ook o n
h i s fac e . " B u t if we're talking about an accident, y o u m i g h t never see h e r
aga i n ."
"That's tru e ."
"Also, sometimes wh en a cat's on the prowl for sex it might wander off
and have trouble finding its way back home aga i n ."
" I f Nakata went out of Nakano Wa rd , finding my way home wouldn't
be easy."
"That's happened to me a few times. Course that was a long time a go ,
wh en I was much younger," Otsuka said, eyes narrowed a s h e searched h i s

memory. "Once you 're lost, you pani c . You 're i n total despa ir, not knowing
what to do. 1 hate it when that happens. Sex can be a real p a i n that way,
course when you get in the mood all you can th ink about i s what's right under
your nose - that's sex, all right. So that cat - what was h e r name? The one
that's lost?"
" Do you mean Coma?"
"Yes, of course.

Coma . I 'd l ike to do what

1 can to help you fi n d her.

A young tortoiseshell cat l ike that, with some n i c e family taking care of
her, wouldn't know the fi rst th ing about making her way in the worl d .
Wou l d n 't be a b l e t o fight off anybody or fend for herself, t h e p o o r th ing.
Unfortu n ately, however, I 've never seen her. 1 th ink you might want to search
somewhere else."
"We l l , th e n , 1 suppose 1 should follow your advice and go to some oth e r
p l a c e t o l o o k . N akata 's very sorry t o have i nterrupted you r n a p . I ' m s u r e I ' l l
stop b y h e re aga i n someti me, so if y o u spot C o m a i n t h e meanti m e , please l e t
me know. I 'd l ike t o give you someth ing for your help."
"No need - I e n j oyed talking with you . Feel free to drop by aga i n . O n
su nny days th i s i s where you 'll mostly find me. Wh en it ra i n s I ' m generally i n
that s h r i n e over there where t h e steps g o down ."
"We l l , thank you very much. Nakata was ve ry happy, too , to be able to
talk with you , Mr. Otsuka. 1 can't always speak so easily to every cat 1 meet.
Sometimes when 1 try the cat is on his guard and runs away without saying a
word . Whe n a l l 1 ever said was hello."
" I can well imagi n e . Th ere 're all sorts of cats - j ust l ike there're a l l sorts
of peopl e."
"That's exactly right. Nakata feels the same way. There are a l l kinds of
people i n the worl d , and all kinds of cats."
Otsuka stretched and looked up at the sky. Colden s u n l i ght fi l l e d the
vacant lot but the air held a hint of ra i n , someth i n g Otsuka was able to sense.
"Didn't you say that when you were l i ttle you had an accident, and that's why
you 're not so smart?"
"Yes, that's right. That's exactly what Nakata sa i d . 1 had an accident when
I was nine years old."
"What sort of accident?"
"Nakata can't really remember. They don't know why, but 1 had a h igh
fever for about three weeks . 1 was unconscious the wh ole ti m e . 1 was asleep i n
a b e d i n a hospital, they told m e , with an

intra venus i n m e . A n d when

1

finally woke u p , I couldn't remember a th ing. I 'd forgotten my father's fac e ,
m y mother's fac e , h o w t o read, how t o a d d , what m y house looked l ike i n s i d e .

47

Even my own name. My head was compl etely empty, l ike a bathtub a fter you
pull the plug. They tell me before the accident Nakata always got good
grades. But once I collapsed and woke up I was dumb. My mother died a long
time ago, but she used to c ry about th is a lot. Because I got stup i d . My fath e r
n ever c r i e d , but h e w a s always angry."
" I nstead of being smart, though , you found yourself able to talk with
cats . "
"That's correct."
" I nteresti ng . . . . "
" B esides that, I ' m always healthy and haven't been s i ck o n c e . I don't have
any cavities, and don't have to wear glasses."
"As far as I can tel l , you seem fa i rly i ntell igent."
"Is that so?" Nakata said, inclining his head. " Nakata's well past s i xty
n ow, Mr. Otsuka . Once I got past sixty I was qu ite used to being d u m b , a n d
people not having anyth ing t o do with me. You can s u rvive without riding
tra i n s . Fath er's dead, so nobody hits me anymore . M other's dead too , so she
doesn't c ry. So actually, i f you say I'm pretty smart, it's a bit upsetting. You s e e ,
if I ' m not dumb t h e n t h e Governor won't give me a

sub city anymore, and n o
m o r e special bus pass. If the Governor says , You 're not dumb after a ll, th e n
Nakata doesn't know w h a t t o say. So th is i s fi n e , being d u m b . "
"What I ' m trying t o s a y i s your problem isn't that you 're dumb," Otsuka
said, a n earnest look on his face.
" Really?"
"Your probl em i s that your

shadow i s a b i t - how should I put it? Faint. I

thought th is the fi rst time I laid eyes on you , that th e shadow you cast on the
ground i s only half as dark as that of ordinary peopl e . "
" I see . . . . "
" I ran across another person l ike that once."
Mouth slightly a j ar, Nakata stared at Otsuka . "You mean you saw somebody l ike Nakata ? "
"Yes, I did. That's w h y I wasn't so surprised that y o u c o u l d t a l k t o cats . "
"Wh e n w a s that?"
"A long time ago, when I was still a you ngster. But I can't remember the
deta i l s - the person 's face or name or where and when we met. As I s a i d
before, cats don't have that sort of memory."
"I see."
"That person's shadow, too, l ooked l ike half of it had gotten separated
from h i m . I t was as fa int as yours."
"I see."

"What I th ink is th i s : You should give up looking for lost cats and start
searc h i n g for the other half of your shadow."
Nakata tugged a few times at the bill of his hat in h i s hands. "To tel l the
truth , Nakata 's had that fee l i n g before. That my shadow i s weak. Oth e r
people m i g h t not noti c e , b u t I d o . "
"That's good , th e n ," t h e cat said.
" B u t I ' m al ready old, and may not l ive mu ch longer. Mother's al ready
dead . Fath er's already dead . Wh ether you 're smart or d u m b , can read or
can't, whether you 've got a shadow or not, once the time comes, everybody
passes on. You die and they cremate you . You turn i nto ashes and they bury
you at a place called Karasuyama. Ka rasuyama's in Setagaya Wa rd. Once
they b u ry you th ere, though , you probably can't th ink about anyth i ng a ny­
more. And if you can't th ink, then you can't get confused . So i s n ' t the way I
am now j ust fi n e ? What I

can

do, wh i l e I ' m al ive, is n ever go out of Nakano

Ward . But when I d i e , I'll have to go to Karasuya m a . That can't be helped."
"What you th ink about it i s enti rely up to you , of cours e ," Otsuka sa i d ,
a n d aga i n began l icking the pads of his paw. "Though y o u should consider
how you r shadow feels about it. It might have a bit of a n i n feriority com­
plex - as a shadow, that i s . If I were a shadow, I know I wouldn't l ike to be half
of what I should be."
" I understand," Nakata said. "You may well be right. Nakata's n ever
thought about it. I'll th ink about it more after I get home."
"An excellent idea."
The two of th e m were silent for a wh i l e . Nakata qui etly stood up, care­
fully brush i n g away stray bits of grass from h i s trousers, and put on h i s th read­
bare hat. H e a d j usted i t a few times, until he got the angle j ust right. He
shouldered his canvas bag and said, "Thank you very kindly. Nakata really
values you r o p i n i o n s , M r. Otsuka. I hope you stay happy and well."
"You too . "
Mter Nakata left, Otsuka l a y down aga i n i n t h e grass and c l o s e d h i s eye s .
There w a s stil l some time before t h e c l o u d s would come and t h e ra i n would
start. His mind a blank, he fell asleep for a short nap.

Chapter 7

A

t seven-fifteen I eat breakfast in the restaurant next to the l obby ­
toast, hot milk, ham and eggs . But th i s free h otel b reakfast doesn't
come close to fi l l i ng me up. The food's all gone before I rea l i z e it,

and I ' m sti ll h u ngry. I look around, and seconds on toast don't seem l ikely to
materialize. I let out a big sigh .
"We l l , what are you gonna do?" the boy named C row says .
H e 's sitting right across from me.
"You 're not back home anymore , where you can stuff yourself with what­
ever you l ike," he says . " I mea n , you 've run away from home, right? Get that
through your head. You 're used to getting up early and eati ng a h u ge break­
fast, but those days are long gone, my friend. You'll have to scrape by on what
they give you . You know what they say about how the size of your stomach
can adj ust to the amollnt of food YOll eat? Wel l , you 're about to see i f that's
really tru e . You r stomach's gonna get smaller, though that'll take some time.
Th ink you can handle it?"
"Yeah, I can handle it," I reply.
"Good," C row tells me. "You 're supposed to be the toughest fiftee n-yea r­
old on the planet, remember?"
I give him a nod.
"We l l , the n , how about you stop staring at your empty plate a n d get a
move o n ? "
Fol l owing th i s advi ce, I stand up and go t o t h e front d e s k t o negotiate
over the price of my roo m . I explain I ' m a student at a private h i gh school
i n Tokyo and have come here to write my graduation paper. (Wh i c h isn't a
total l i e , s i n c e the h i gh school affi l iated with my school has th i s kind of
setu p . ) I add that I'm collecting materials for the paper at the Komura M e m o­
rial Library. Th ere's much more to research than I 'd imagined, so I 'l l h ave to
stay at least a week in Takamats u . But since I ' m on a budget, would the dis­
counted room rate be possible not j ust for three days , but for the whole t i m e

I ' m here? I offer to pay each day in advance, and promise not to cause any
trouble.
I stand there i n front of the girl i n charge , trying to do my best i m i tation
of a nice, well-brought-up young man who's i n a tight spot. N o dyed hair for
m e , no p i ercings . I have on a clean wh ite Ralph Lauren polo s h i rt, c h i nos,
and a pair of b rand-new Topsiders . My teeth a re gleaming and I smell l ike
soap and shampoo. I know how to speak pol itely. Wh en I feel l ike it, I ' m
pretty good at i mp ress i n g people older than m e .
T h e girl l i stens s i l ently, nodding, h e r l ips slightly twi sted u p . S h e 's petite,
and wearing a green uniform blazer over a wh ite blouse . She l ooks a l i ttle
sleepy, but goes about her morning duties briskly. S h e 's about the same age as
my sister.
" I understand," she says , "but I have to clear it with the manager. We
should h ave a n answer for you by noon." Her tone is businesslike, but I can
tell that i n h e r book, I pass. She n otes down my name and room number. I
have no idea whether th i s negotiating will get me anywhere. It m i gh t blow u p
i n my fac e - i f the manager demands t o see my student I D , say, or t r i e s t o get
i n touch with my parents . ( Of course I gave a phony home phone number
when I registered . ) B u t seeing as how my funds are l i m ited , I figure it's worth
the risk.
I check the Yel l ow Pages and call a publ ic gym and ask about th e i r weight
machines. They have most of what I need, and it only costs five b u c ks a day.
I get directions from the stati on, thank them , and hang u p .
I g o back t o my room for m y backpack, then h i t th e streets . I c o u l d j ust
leave my stuff i n th e room , or i n the hotel safe , but I feel better carrying i t all
with m e . I t's l ike it's a part of me already, and I can't let go.
On the bus from the terminal i n front of the station to the gym , I can feel
my face tighten up, I ' m so nervous. Suppose somebody asks why a kid my age
is traipsing off to the gym i n the middle of the day? I don't know th i s town and
have no idea what these people are th i nking. B u t n o one gives m e a second
gla n c e . I'm starting to feel l ike the I nvisible Man or someth i n g . I pay the
entrance fee at the desk, no questions asked, and get a key to a l ocker. Afte r
changing i nto shorts and a T-sh i rt in the locker room , I do some stretc h i n g
exercises. A s my muscles relax, so do I . I ' m safe inside th i s conta i n e r called
me. With a l i ttle c l i ck, the outl i nes of th i s being - me - fit right i n s i d e and are
l ocked n eatly away. Just the way I l ike it. I ' m where I belong.
I start on my c i rc u i t tra i ning. With Prince blasti ng away on my Walkman ,
I put i n a good h o u r o f tra i n i ng, making m y usual rou n d of the seven
machines. I th ought for sure a gym i n such a small town would be fu ll of

dated machines, but these are the latest models, with th e metal l i c smell of
brand-new steel . The fi rst round I do with l ight weights, the n i n c rease the
weight for the second c i rcuit. I know exactly how much weight and how
many reps work for me. Pretty soon I start to sweat and stop every once in a
wh i l e to take a swig from the bottle and a bite out of a lemon I bought o n
t h e w a y over.
Once I finish training I take a hot shower using th e soap and shampoo
I 've brought along. I do a good job of wash ing my cock, not too many years
out of i ts foresk i n , and under my arms, balls, and butt. I weigh myself and flex
my muscles a bit in front of a mi rror. F inally I rinse out my sweaty shorts and
T-sh i rt in the s i nk, wring them out, and stow the m away i n a plastic bag.
I take a bus back to the station and have a stea ming bowl of udon in the
same diner as the day before . I take my time, gaz ing out the wi ndow as I eat.
The statio n 's packed with people streaming i n and out, all of the m dressed i n
the i r favorite clothes, bags o r briefcases i n hand, each o n e dash ing off t o take
care of some press ing business. I stare at th i s ceaseless, rush i n g c rowd and
imagine a time a hundred years from now. I n a h u ndred yea rs everybody
here � me incl uded � will have disappeared from the face of the earth and
tur n e d i nto ashes or dust. A weird thought, but everyth i n g i n front of m e starts
to seem u n rea l , l ike a gust of wind could blow it all away.
I spread my hands out in front of me and take a good hard look at the m .
What am I always so tense about? Why th i s desperate struggle j ust t o s u rvive ?
I shake my head, turn from the window, clear my mind of thoughts of a hun­
dred years away. I 'l l j ust th ink about

now.

About books wa iting to be read in

the l ibra ry, machines i n the gym I haven't worked out o n . Th inking about
anyth ing else i s n 't going to get me anywhere .
"That's th e ti cket," C row tells me. " Remember, you 're supposecl t o be the
toughest fifteen-yea r-old on the planet."

Like the day before , I buy a box lunch at the station and take the tra i n , arriv­
i n g at the Komura Library at eleven-th i rty. And sure e nough , Osh i m a 's there
at the cou nter. Today h e 's wearing a blue rayon s h i rt buttoned to the neck,
white j eans, and wh ite tennis shoes. H e 's sitting at h i s desk, absorbed i n some
mass ive book, with th e same yellow pencil, I guess , lying beside h i m . H i s
bangs a r e a l l over h i s face. Wh en I come i n he looks up, smiles, a n d takes m y
backpack from m e .
" Stil l n o t going back t o school , I see."
'Tm n ever goi ng back," I confess.

"A libra ry's a pretty good alternative, th e n ," he says . He turns around to
check the ti m e on the clock behind h i m , then goes back to h i s reading.
I head off to the reading room and back to

Arabian Nights. Like always,

once I settl e down and start fl ipping pages, I can't stop. Th e B urton edition
has all the stories I remember readi ng as a child, but they're longer, with
more episodes and plot twists, and so much more absorb i n g that i t's h a rd to
beli eve they're the same. They're fu ll of obscene, violent, sexua l , basically
outrageous scenes. Like the genie i n the bottle th ey have th i s sort of vital , l iv­
ing sense of pl ay, of freedom, that common sense can't keep bottl ed up. I l ove
it and can't l e t go. Compared to those faceless hordes of people rus h i n g
through t h e tra i n stati o n , th ese c razy, preposterous stories of a thousand yea rs
ago are, at least to m e , much more real . H ow that's poss i b l e , I don't know. I t's
pretty weird.
At one o ' c l ock I go out to the garden aga i n , sit on the porc h , a n d eat my
l u n c h . I'm about halfway done when Osh ima comes ove r and says I h ave a
phone cal l .
" A phone c a l l ? " I say, at a loss for words. " For m e ? "
"As l o n g a s you r name's Kafka Tamura ."
I blush, get to my feet, and take th e cordless phone from h i m .
It's the girl a t the front desk a t the hote l , most l ikely checking t o s e e i f I ' m
really doing research at the l i b rary. S h e sounds rel i eved t o fi n d out I hadn't
l i e d to her. " I talked with the manager," she says , "and he said they've never
done th i s before, but seeing as how you 're young and there are special c i r­
cumstances, h e ' l l make an exception and let you stay at the rate the YMCA
arranged for you . We 're not so busy right now, he said, so we can bend the
rules a bit. H e also said that l i b rary's supposed to be really n i c e , so he hopes
you'll be able to take your time and do as much research as you need to ."
I b reathe a s igh of rel ief and thank her. I feel a l i ttle bad about lying, but
there 's not much I can do about it. I 've got to bend some rules myself if I want
to survive . 1 hang up and hand the phone back to Osh i m a .
"You 're t h e o n l y h i gh school student w h o c o m e s here , so I figured it must
be for you ," h e says . "I told her you 're here from morning till n i ght, your nose
stuck in a book. Wh i c h i s true."
"Thanks," I tell h i m .
" Kafka Ta mura ? "
"That's my n a m e . "
" Kind of strange ."
"Well , that's my name," I i nsist.
" I assume you 've read some of Kafka 's stori es?"

53

I nod.

"The Castle, and The Trial, The Metamorph osis,' plus that weird

story about an execution devi ce."
" ' I n the Penal Col ony,' '' Osh ima says . " I l ove that story. Only Kafka
could have written that."
"That's my favorite of his short stories."
" N o kidding?"
I nod .
"Why's that?"
I t takes me a wh i l e to gather my th oughts. " I th ink what Kafka does i s
give a purely mechanical explanation of that complex m a c h i n e i n t h e story,
as sort of a substitute for explaining th e situation we're i n . What I mean i s . . . "
I h ave to give it some more thought. "What I mean i s , that's h i s own device
for expl a i n i n g the kind of l ives we lead. Not by talking about our s ituati o n ,
but b y talking about th e deta ils o f the machine."
"That makes sense," Osh ima says and lays a hand on my shoulder, the
gesture natural , and fri endly. " I imagine Franz Kafka would agree with you ."
H e takes the cordless phone and disappears back i nto the building. I stay
on th e veranda for a wh i l e , finishing my lunch, drinking my mi neral wate r ,
watc h i n g t h e b i rds i n t h e garden. For all I know they're t h e same b i rds fro m
yeste rday. T h e sky's covered with clouds, not a speck of b l u e i n s i ght.
Osh ima most l ikely found my explanation of the Kafka story convi ncing.
To some extent at least. But what I really wanted to say didn't get ac ross . I
wasn ' t j ust givi ng some general th eory of Kafka 's ficti o n , I was talking about
someth i ng very real . Kafka's complex, mysterious execution device wasn't
some metaphor or all egory - it's actually

here, all around m e . But I don't

th ink anybody would get that. Not Osh i m a . Not a nybody.
I go back to th e reading room, where I s i nk down in the sofa and i nto
the world of The Arabian

Nights. Slowly, l ike a movie fadeout, the real world

evaporates. I ' m alone, inside the world of the story. My favorite fee l i ng in
th e worl d .
Whe n at fi v e I ' m about t o leave Osh ima's stil l beh i n d t h e counter, read­
ing the same book, his s h i rt still without a s i ngle wrinkl e . Like always , a
couple strands of h a i r have fallen across h i s fac e . The hanels of the electric
clock on the wal l behind h i m soundlessly tick forward. Everyth i n g around
him is silent and clean. I doubt the guy ever sweats or h i ccups. H e l ooks up
and hanels me my backpack. H e frowns a bit, l ike it's too heavy for h i m . " Do
you take th e tra i n here from town?"
I noel.
" I f you 're going to come every day, you should have th is." H e hands m e a

54

sheet of paper, the tra i n schedule, it turns out, between Takarnatsu Stati on
and the station where I get off for the l i bra ry. ''They usually run o n time."
"Thanks," I say, slipping the sheet i n my backpack.
" Ka fka - I d o n 't h ave any idea where you came fro m , or what your plans
are, but you can't stay i n a h otel foreve r, right?" h e says, choosing h i s words
ca reful ly. With the fi ngers of his left hand he che cks the tips of his pencils.
Not that i t's nec essary, since they're all as sharp as can be.
I don't say a nyth ing.
' ' I ' m not trying to butt i n , bel i eve me. I j ust th ought I might as well ask.
A boy your age i n a place you 've never been before - I can't imagine it's easy
going."
I nod aga i n .
"Are you h eaded someplace else after here? Or a r e you goi ng t o b e h ere
for a wh i l e ? "
" I haven't d e c i d e d yet, but I th ink I ' l l be here for a wh i l e . No o t h e r place
to go," I admit.
Maybe I should tel l Osh ima eve ryth ing. I ' m pretty sure h e won't put m e
down , give me a l ectur e , or try t o force s o m e c o m m o n s e n s e on m e . B u t right
now I'm tryi ng to keep my words to a minimum. Plus I'm not exactly used to
tel l i n g people how I fee l .
" For t h e time b e i n g , the n , y o u th ink y o u can manage?" Osh i m a asks .
I give a short nod.
"Good luck, th e n ," he says .

Except for a few minor deta i l s , I spend the next seven days in the same way.
( E xcept for Monday, of course , when th e l i b rary's closed, and I spend th e day
at a big publ i c l ibrary. ) The alarm clock gets me up at s ix-th i rty every morn­
ing, and I gulp down the hote l 's pseudo-breakfast. If th e c h estnut-h a i red girl's
behind the front desk, I give her a l i ttle wave . She always nods and repays me
with a smile. I th i nk she l ikes m e , and I kind of l ike her, too . C o u l d

she be my

s i ster? The thought does c ross my mind.
Every morning I do some easy stretching exe rcises i n my roo m , and
when the time rolls around I go to the gym and run through the usual c i r c u i t
tra i ning. Always t h e same amount of weight, th e same n u m b e r of reps . No
more , n o less. I take a shower and wash every inch of m e . I weigh myself, to
make sure my weight's staying steady. Before noon I take the tra i n to th e
Komura Library. Exchange a few words with Oshima when I give h i m my
backpack, and when I p i ck it up. Eat lunch out on the veranda . And rea cl .

The Arabian Nights I tackle the complete works of Nats u m e

Soseki - there 're sti l l a couple o f h i s novels I haven't r e a d yet. A t fi v e I e x i t the

of those two , nobody s e e m s t o worry about me. C h a n c e s a r e pretty s l i m a kid
skipp i n g school would hang out i n either one. I eat dinner at the diner in
front of the stati o n . I try to eat as many vegetables as I c a n , and occasionally
buy fru i t from a stand and peel it using the knife I took from my fath er's desk.
I buy c u c u mbers and celery, wash th em i n the sink at the hote l , and eat th e m
with mayonnaise. Sometimes I p i c k up a conta i n e r of m i l k from t h e mini­

Back in my room I jot down what I did that day i n my diary, l i sten to
Radiohead on my Walkman , read a l i ttl e , and then i t's l ights out at eleve n .
Sometimes I masturbate before going t o sleep. I th ink about t h e g i r l at the
front desk, putting any thoughts of her potentially being my s i ster out of my
head, for the time being. I hardly watch any 1V or read any n ewspapers .
But on the evening of the eighth day - as had to happen sooner or later ­

Impressions

of

the

interviewer,

Lt.

Robert

O'Connor:

Professor

Tsukayama was quite calm and relaxed throughout the interview, as one
might expect of an expert of his caliber. He is one of the leading psychia­
trists in Japan and has published a number of outstanding books on the
subject. Unlike most Japanese, he avoids vague statements, drawing a
sharp distinction between facts and conjecture. Before the war he was an
exchange scholar at Stanford, and is quite fluent in English. He is surely
well liked and respected by many.

We were o rdered by the m i l i tary to i mmediately undertake a n exa m i nation of
the c h i l dren i n questi o n . I t was th e middle of November 1944. I t was quite
unusual for us to receive requests or orders from the military. The m i l itary, of
course , had its own extens ive medical branch , and being a self-contained

57

entity that put a h i gh priority on secrecy, they usually prefe rred to handle
matters i n ternal ly. Apart from the rare times when they needed th e special
knowledge and techniques that only outside researchers or physicians had,
they seldom appealed to civil ian doctors or researchers.
Th us when they broached th is we immediately surmised that someth i n g
extraordi nary had occurred. Frankly, I didn't l ike t o work u n d e r m i l i ta ry
directions. I n most cases th eir goals were strictly uti l itarian, with no i n terest
i n pursuing truth i n a n academic sense, only arriving at conclusions that
accorded with their preconceptions. They were n 't th e type of people swayed
by logi c . But it was warti me and we couldn't very well say no. We had to keep
quiet and do exactly as we were told .
We 'd b e e n continu ing our research despite th e American a i r ra i d s . Most
of our undergrads and grad students, though , had been drafte d . Students in
psyc h i atry weren't exempt for the draft, unfortunately. Wh e n the order came
from the m i l i tary we dropped everyth ing and took a tra i n to [ name delete d ]
i n Yamanash i Prefectur e . There were three of u s - myself and a colleague
from the Psych i atry Department, as well as a research physician fro m the
Department of Neurosurgery with whom we 'd been conducting researc h .
A s soon as w e got there they warned us that what they were about to
reveal was a milita ry secret we could never divulge . Then they told us about
the incident that had occurred at the beginning of the month . H ow s ixteen
schoolch ildren had lost consciousness i n the h i l l s and fi fteen of the m had
rega i n e d consciousness th ereafter, with no memory of what had taken place .
One boy, they told us, hadn't rega ined consciousness and was still in a m i l i ­
tary hospital i n Tokyo .
The mil itary doctor who 'd examined the c h i l d re n right after the inci­
dent, an i nternal medicine spec ial ist named M a j o r Toyam a , gave u s a
deta iled explanation about what had transpired. Many army doctors are more
l ike bureaucrats concerned with protecting the i r own l i ttl e preserve tha n with
medi c i n e , but fortu nately Major Toyama wasn't one of the m . He was honest
and straightforward, and obviously a talented phys i c i a n . H e never tried to use
th e fact that we were civilians to lord it over us or conceal a nyth i n g from us,
as some might do. H e provided all the deta ils we needed, i n a very profes­
sional manner, and showed us medical records that had been kept o n the
c h i ld re n . H e wanted to get to the bottom of th i s as much as a nybody. We were
all qu ite impressed by h i m .
T h e most important fact w e gleaned from th e records was that, medically
speaking, the i n c ident had caused no lasting i mpact on the c h ildren . From
right afte r th e event to the present day, the exami nations and tests c o n s istently

indicated no internal or exte rnal abnormal ities. The c h i l dren were leading
healthy l ives , j ust as they had before the incident. Deta i l e d exa m i n ations re­
vealed that several of the c h i l dren had paras ites, but noth i n g out of the ordi­
nary. Otherwise they were compl etely asymptomatic - no headaches, nausea,
pa i n , loss of appetite, insomnia, l i stlessness , diarrh e a , nightmare s . Noth i ng.
The one notable th ing was that th e two-hour span during wh i c h the chil­
dren had been unconscious i n th e hills was erased from th e i r m e m o ry. As i f
that part had been extracted i n toto . Rather than a memory loss, i t w a s more a
memory

lack. These aren't medical terms, and I 'm using the m for the sake of
conve n i e n c e , but th ere's a big difference between loss and lack. I suppose it's
l ike - well , imagine a tra i n steaming down a track. The freight's disappeared
from o n e of the cars. A car that's empty inside - that's
car itself has vanished, that's

loss. Wh e n the whole

lack.

We discussed the possibility that the children had breathed in poison gas.
Dr. Toyama said that naturally they'd considered th i s . That's why the military is
involved, he tol d us, but it seems a remote possibility. He th en tol d us, Now this
is a military secret, so you can 't tell anyone. The army is definitely developing
poison gas and biological weapons, but this is carried out mainly by a special
unit on the Chinese mainland, not in Japan itself It's too dangerous a project
to attempt in a place as densely populated as Japan. I can't tell you whether
or not these sorts of weapons are stored anywhere in Japan, though I can assure
you most definitely that they are not kept anywhere in Yamanashi Prefecture.
- So he categorically denied that special weapons, including poison gas,
were being stored in the prefecture?
Correct. He was very clear about that. We bas ically had no choice except
to bel ieve h i m , but he sounded bel ievabl e . We also concluded that it was
h ighly unl ikely that poison gas had been dropped from a B-29. If the Ame ricans
had actually developed such a weapon and decided to use it, they'd drop it on
some large city where the effects would be massive . Dropping a canister or two
on such a remote place wouldn't allow them to ascertain what effects the
weapon had. Besides, even if you accepted the premise that a poison gas had
been dropped on the spot, any gas that makes children fal l unconscious for two
hours with no other lasting effects would be worthless as m i l i tary arsenal .
Also we knew that no poison gas , wheth er manmade or natur a l l y occur ­
r i n g , w o u l d act l ike th i s , leaving no aftereffects whatsoever. Especially when
you 're dealing with c h i ldren, who are more sensitive and have a more deli­
cate immune system than adults , there wou l d have to be some aftereffects ,

59

particularly in the eyes or mucous membranes. We c rossed off food poisoning
for the same reason.
S o what we were left with were psychological problems, or problems
deal i ng with bra i n functi o n . I n a case l ike that, standard medical method­
ology wouldn't help at a l l i n isolating the cause. The effects would be i nvis­
ible, someth i n g you couldn't quantify. We finally understood why we had
been called here by the military to consult.
We interviewed every child i nvolved in the incident, as well as the home­
room teacher and attending physician. Major Toyama also parti cipate d . But
these inte rviews yielded almost nothing new - we merely c o n fi rmed what the
m a j o r had a l ready told us. The children had no memory whatsoever of the
event. They saw what looked l ike a plane gl inting h igh up i n the sky, c l i mbed
up Owan yam a , and began hu nting mushrooms. Th e n there's a gap i n ti m e
and t h e next th ing they recall is lying on t h e ground, surrounded b y a group
of worried-looking teachers and pol icemen. They fel t fi n e , without any pa i n ,
discomfort, or nausea. Th eir minds j ust fel t a b i t blank, as you do w h e n you
fi rst wake up i n the morning. That was a l l . Each child gave the same exact
response .
After conducting these intervi ews we concluded that th is was a case of
mass hypnosis. From the symptoms the homeroom teacher and school doctor
observed at th e scene, th is hypothesis made the most sense. The regul a r
movement of the eyes, t h e sl ight lowering of respirati o n , heartbeat, and tem­
perature, the lack of memory - it all fit. The teacher alone didn't lose con­
sciousness because for whatever reason what produced th is mass hypnosis
didn't affect adults.
We weren't able to pinpoint the cause, however. Generally speaking,
th ough , mass hypnotism requ ires two elements . First, the group must be
close-knit and homogeneous, and placed i n restricted circu mstances. Sec­
ondly, someth i n g has to trigger the reaction, someth i n g that acts s i multane­
ously on everyon e . I n th is case it might have been the gl int of that a i rplane
they saw. This i s j ust a hypothesis, mind you - we weren't able to fi n d any
other candidates - and there may very well have been some oth e r trigger that
set it off. I broached the idea of it being a case of mass hypnosis with M a j o r
Toyam a , making it c l e a r th is w a s merely a conj ecture. My two colleagues
generally conc urred . Coincidentally, th is also happened to be indirectly
related to a research topic we were investigati ng ourselves.
"That does seem to fit the evidence," Major Toyama said after giving it
some thought. 'Th is is not my field, but it would appear to be the l ikel i est
explanati o n . But th ere's one th ing I don't understand - what made th e m

60

snap out of this mass hypnosis?There'd have to be some sort of reverse trigger­
ing mechanism. "
I really don't know, I admitted. All I could do was speculate. My hypoth­
esis was this: There is a system in place which, after a certain amount of time
passes, automatically breaks the spell. Our bodies have strong defense mech­
anisms in place, and if an outside system takes over momentarily, once a cer­
tain amount of time has passed it's like an alarm bell goes off, activating an
emergency system that deprograms this foreign object that blocks our built-in
defenses-in this case the effects of mass hypnosis-and eliminates it.
Unfortunately, I don't have the materials in front of me, so I can't quote
the exact figures, but as I told Major Toyama, there have been reports of simi­
lar incidents occurring abroad. All of them are considered mysteries with no
logical explanation. A large number of children lose consciousness at the same
time, and several hours later wake up without any memory of what happened.
This incident is quite unusual, in other words, but not without prece­
dent. One strange instance took place around 1930, in the outskirts of a small
village in Devonshire, England. For no apparent reason, a group of thirty ju­
nior high students walking down a country path fell to the ground, one after
the other, and lost consciousness. Several hours later, as if nothing had hap­
pened, they regained consciousness and walked back to school under their
own steam. A physician examined them right away but could find nothing
medically wrong. Not one of them could recall what had taken place.
At the end of the last century, a similar incident occurred in Australia.
Outside of Adelaide fifteen teenage girls from a private girls school were on
an outing when all of them lost consciousness, and then regained it. Again
there were no injuries, no aftereffects. It ended up classified as a case of heat­
stroke, but all of them had lost consciousness and recovered it at nearly the
same time, and nobody showed symptoms of heatstroke, so the real cause
remains a mystery. Besides, it wasn't a particularly hot day when it occurred.
Probably there was no other accounting for what had taken place, so they
decided this was the best explanation.
These cases share several things in common: they took place among a
group of either young boys or girls, somewhat distant from their school, all of
whom lost consciousness essentially simultaneously and then regained it
about the same time, with no one displaying any aftereffects. It's reported that
some of the adults who happened to be with the children also lost conscious­
ness, and some did not. Each case was different in that regard.
There are other similar incidents, but these two are the best docu­
mented, and thus are representative cases in the literature of this phenome-

non. This recent instance in Yamanashi Prefecture, however, contains one
element that differentiates it from the rest: namely that one boy did not regain
consciousness. This child is the key to unlocking the truth to this whole
event. We returned to Tokyo after our interviews in Yamanashi and went
straight to the army hospital where the boy was being cared for.
-T he army, then, was only interested in this incident because they sus­
pected it may have been caused by poison gas?

That's my understanding. But Major Toyama would know more about
this,and I suggest you ask him directly.
-Major Toyama was killed in Tokyo in March 1945, in the line of duty,
during an air raid.

I'm very sorry to hear that. We lost so many promising people in the war.
-Eventually, though, the army concluded that this was not caused by
any chemical weapons. They couldn't determine the cause, but they
decided, didn't they, that it was unrelated to the war?

Yes,I believe that's true. At this point they'd concluded their investigation
into the matter. But the boy, Nakata, was allowed to remain in the military
hospital, since Major Toyama was personally interested in the case and had
some connections there. Thus we were able to go to the military hospital
every day, and take turns staying overnight to investigate this unconscious
boy's case further,from a number of angles.
Though unconscious,the boy's bodily functions nevertheless continued
normally. He was given nutrients intravenously and discharged urine at regu­
lar intervals. He shut his eyes at night and went to sleep when we turned out
the lights,then opened them again in the morning. Other than being uncon­
scious,he appeared completely healthy. He was in a coma,but didn't dream,
apparently. When people dream they exhibit characteristic eye movements
and facial expressions. Your heart rate goes up as you react to experiences in
your dreams. But with the Nakata boy we couldn't detect any of these indica­
tors. His heart rate, breathing, and temperature were still slightly on the low
side,but surprisingly stable.
It might sound strange to put it this way, but it seemed like the real
Nakata had gone off somewhere, leaving behind for a time the fleshly con-

tainer, which in his absence kept all his bodily functions going at the mini­
mum level needed to preserve itself. The term "spirit projection " sprang to
mind. Are you familiar with it? Japanese folk tales are full of this sort of thing,
where the soul temporarily leaves the body and goes off a great distance to
take care of some vital task and then returns to reunite with the body. The
sort of vengeful spirits that populate

The Tale o{Cenji may be something sim­

ilar. The notion of the soul not just leaving the body at death but-assuming
the will is strong enough-also being able to separate from the body of the liv­
ing is probably an idea that took root in Japan in ancient times. Of course
there's no scientific proof of this,and I hesitate to even raise the idea.
The practical problem that faced us was how to wake this boy from his
coma,and restore him to consciousness. Struggling to find a reverse trigger to
undo the hypnosis, we tried everything. We brought his parents there, had
them shout out his name. We tried that for several days, but there was no
reaction. We tried every trick in the book as far as hypnosis goes-clapping
our hands in different ways right in front of his face. We played music he
knew,read his schoolbooks aloud to him, let him catch a whiff of his favorite
foods. We even brought in his cat from home,one he was particularly fond of.
We used every method we could think of to bring him back to reality, but
nothing worked.
About two weeks into this, when we'd run out of ideas and were
exhausted and discouraged,the boy woke up on his own. Not because of any­
thing we'd done. Without warning,as if the time for this had been decided in
advance,he came to.
- Did anything out of the ordinary take place that day?

Nothing worth mentioning. It was a day like any other. At ten a.m. the
nurse came to draw a blood sample. Right after that he choked a bit, and
some of the blood spilled on the sheets. Not much, and they changed the
sheets right away. That was about the only thing different that day. The boy
woke up about a half hour after that. Out of the blue he sat up in bed,
stretched,and looked around the room. He had regained consciousness,and
medically he was perfectly fine. Soon,though,we realized he'd lost his entire
memory. He couldn't even remember his own name. The place he lived in,
his school, his parents' faces-it was all gone. He couldn't read, and wasn't
even aware this was Japan or the Earth. He couldn't even fathom the concept
of Japan or the Earth. He'd returned to this world with his mind wiped clean.
The proverbial blank slate.

Chapter 9

W

hen I come to I'm in thick brush,lying there on the damp ground
like some log. I can't see a thing, it's so dark.
My head propped up by prickly brambles, I take a deep

breath and smell plants, and dirt,and,mixed in, a faint whiff of dog crap. I
can see the night sky through the tree branches. There's no moon or stars,but
the sky is strangely bright. The clouds act as a screen, reflecting all the light
from below. An ambulance wails off in the distance,grows closer,then fades
away. By listening closely,I can barely catch the rumble of tires from traffic. I
figure I must be in some corner of the city.
I try to pull myself together and pick up the scattered jigsaw puzzle
pieces of

me

lying all around.

This is a first, I think. Or is it?I had this feeling

somewhere before. But when? I search my memory, but that fragile thread
snaps. I close my eyes and let time pass by.
With a jolt of panic I remember my backpack. Where could I have left it?
No way can I lose it-everything I own's inside. But how am I going to find it
in the dark?I try to get to my feet,but my fingers have lost all their strength.
I struggle to raise my left hand-why is it so heavy all of a sudden?-and
bring my watch close to my face,fixing my eyes on it. The digital numbers
read 11:26. May 28. I think of my diary.

Ma y 28 . . . good-so I haven't lost a

day. I haven't been lying here, out cold, for days. At most my consciousness
and I parted company for a few hours. Maybe four hours, I figure.
May 28 . . . a day like any other,the same exact routine. Nothing out of
the ordinary. I went to the gym,then to the Komura Library. Did my usual
workout on the machines, read Soseki on the same sofa. Had dinner near
the station. The fish dinner, as I recall. Salmon, with a second helping of
rice, some miso soup, and salad. After that . . . after that I don't know what
happened.
My left shoulder aches a little. As my senses return, so does the pain. I
must have bumped into something pretty hard. I rub that part with my right

hand. There's no wound, or swelling. Did I get hit by a car, maybe? But my
clothes aren't ripped. and the only place that hurts is that spot in my left
shoulder. Probably just a bruise.
I fumble around in the bushes, but all I touch are branches, hard and
twisted like the hearts of bullied little animals. No backpack. I go through my
pant pockets. My wallet's there, thank God. Some cash is in it, the hotel key
card, a phone card. Besides this I've got a coin purse, a handkerchief, a ball­
point pen. As far as I can tell in the dark, nothing's missing. I'm wearing
cream-colored chinos, a white V-neck T-shirt under a long-sleeved dungaree
shirt. Plus my navy blue Topsiders. My cap's vanished, my New York Yankees
baseball cap. I know I had it on when I left the hotel, but not now. I must have
dropped it, or left it someplace. No big deal. Those are a dime a dozen.
Finally I locate my backpack, leaning up against the trunk of a pine tree.
Why in the world would I leave it there and then scramble into this thicket,
only to collapse?

W here the hell am

I,

an ywa y ? My memory's frozen shut.

Anyway, the important thing is that I found it. I take out my mini flashlight
from a side pocket and check out the contents. Nothing seems to be missing.
Thank God the sack with all my cash's there.
I shoulder the backpack and step over bushes, brushing branches out of
the way, until I reach a small clearing. There's a narrow path there, and I fol­
low the beam of my flashlight into a place where there're some lights. It
appears to be the grounds of a Shinto shrine. I'd lost consciousness in a small
woods behind the main shrine building.
A mercury lamp on a high pole illuminates the extensive grounds, cast­
ing a kind of cold light on the inner shrine, the offering box, the votive
tablets. My shadow looks weirdly long on the gravel. I find the shrine's name
on the bulletin board and commit it to memory. Nobody else is around. I
see a restroom nearby and go inside and it turns out to be fairly clean. I take
off my backpack and wash my face, then check out my reflection in the
blurry mirror over the sink. I prepare myself for the worst, and I'm not disap­
pointed-I look like hell. A pale face with sunken cheeks stares back at me,
my neck all muclcly, hair sticking out in all directions.
I notice something dark on the front of my white T-shirt, shaped sort of
like a huge butterfly with wings spread. I try brushing it away, but it won't
come off. I touch it and my hands come away all sticky. I need to calm down,
so consciously taking my time I slowly take off both my shirts. Under the
flickering fluorescent light I realize what this is-darkish blood that's seeped
into the fabric. The blood's still fresh, wet, and there's lots of it. I bring it close
for a sniff, but there's no smell. Some blood's been spattered on the dungaree

65

shirt as well,but only a little,and it doesn't stand out on the dark blue mate­
rial. The blood on the T-shirt is another story-against the white background
there's no mistaking that.
I wash the T-shirt in the sink. The blood mixes with the water,dyeing the
porcelain sink red,though no matter how hard I scrub the stain won't come
out. I'm about to toss the shirt into the garbage can,then decide against it. If
I throw it away, some other place would be better. I wring out the shirt and
stow it in the plastic bag with my other rinsed-out clothes,and stuff the whole
thing into my backpack. I wet my hair and try to get some of the tangles out.
Then I take some soap out of my toilet kit and wash my hands. They're still
trembling a little, but I take my time, carefully washing between my fingers
and under my fingernails. With a damp towel I wipe away the blood that's
seeped onto my bare chest. Then I put on my dungaree shirt,button it up to
my neck,and tuck it into my pants. I don't want people looking at me,so I've
got to look at least halfway normal.
But I'm scared,and my teeth won't stop chattering. Try as I might I can't
get them to stop. I stretch out my hands and look at them. Both are shaking a
bit. They look like somebody else's hands, not my own. Like a pair of little
animals with a life all their own. My palms sting, like I grabbed onto a hot
metal bar.
I rest my hands against the sink and lean forward,my head shoved against
the mirror. I feel like crying,but even if I do,nobody's going to come to my
rescue. Nobody . . .

Man alive, how'd you get all that blood all over you? What the hell were
you doing? But you don't remember a thing, do you. No wounds on you,
though, that's a relief. No real pain, either - except for that throbbing in
your left shoulder. So the blood's gotta be from somebody else, not you.
Somebody else's blood.
Anyway, you can't stay here forever. If a patrol car happens to spot you
here, covered with blood, you're up a creek, my friend. Course going back
to the hotel might not be a good idea. You don't know who might be lying
in wait, ready to jump you. You can't be too careful. Looks like you've
been involved in some crime, something you don't remember. Maybe you
were the perp. Who knows?
Lucky thing you got all your stuff with you. You were always careful
enough to lug everything you own around in that heavy backpack. Good
choice. You did what's right, so don't worry. Don't be afraid. Everything's

66

going to work out. 'Cause remember - you're the toughest fifteen-year-old
on the planet, right? Get a hold of yourself! Take some deep breaths and
start using your head. Things'll be fine. But you gotta be very careful.
That's real blood we're talking about-somebody else's blood. And we're
not just talking a drop or two. As we speak I'll bet somebody's trying to
track you down.
Better get a move on. There's only one thing to do, one place you gotta
go to. And you know where that is.

I take a couple of deep breaths to calm down, then pick up my pack and get
out of the restroom. I crunch along the gravel, the mercury light beating
down on me, and try to get my brain in gear. Throw the switch, turn the
crank, get the old thought process up and running. But it's no go-not
enough juice in the battery to get the engine to turn over. I need someplace
that's safe and warm. That I can escape to for a while and pull myself
together. But where? The only place that comes to mind is the lihrary. But the
Komura Library's shut until tomorrow at eleven, and I need somewhere to lie
low till then.
I come up with an alternative. I sit down where nobody can spot me and
take the cell phone from my backpack. I check to see it's still connected, then
take Sakura's phone number from my wallet and punch in the numhers. My
fingers still aren't working well, and it takes a few times before I get the whole
number right. I don't get her voice mail, thank God. Twelve rings later she
answers. I tell her my name.
"Kafka Tamura," she repeats, not exactly thrilled. "Do you have any idea
how late it is? I've got to get up early tomorrow. "
"I know, I'm sorry to call so late," I tell her. My voice sounds tense. "But
I had no choice. I'm sort of in trouhle, and you're the only one I could
think of."
No response on the other end. Seems like she's checking my tone of
voice, weighing it in her mind.
"Is it something . . . serious? " she finally asks.
"I can't tell you right now, but I think so. You've got to help me. Just this
once. I promise I won't be a bother."
She gives it some thought. Not like she's confused or anything, just
thinking it over. "So where are you? "
I tell her the name of the shrine.
"Is that in Takamatsu City? "

'Tm not totally sure, but I think so. "
"You don't even know where you are?" she says, dumbfounded.
"It's a long story. "
She lets out a sigh. "Grab a cab and come to the Lawson's convenience
store on the corner near my apartment. They have a big sign and you can't
miss it. " She gives me the directions. "Do you have money for a cab? "
'Tm good, " I say.
"All right, " she says and hangs up.

I go out the torii gate at the entrance to the shrine and head for the main road
to flag down a cab. It doesn't take long. I ask the driver if he knows the Law­
son's on that corner, and he says he does. When I ask if it's far, he says no,
about a ten-dollar ride.
The cab stops outside the Lawson's and I pay the driver, my hands still
unsteady. I pick up my backpack and go inside the store. I got there so fast
Sakura hasn't arrived yet. I buy a small carton of milk, heat it up in the
microwave, and sip it slowly. The warm milk slips down my throat and calms
my stomach a little. When I went inside the store the clerk glanced at my
backpack, keeping an eye out for shoplifters, but after that nobody pays
any attention to me. I stand at the magazine rack, pretending to be pick­
ing one out, and check out my reflection in the window. Though my hair's
still a bit of a mess, you can barely see the blood on my dungaree shirt. If any­
body noticed it they'd think it was just a stain. Now all I have to do is stop
trembling.
Ten minutes later Sakura strolls in. It's nearly one a.m. She has on a plain
gray sweatshirt and faded jeans. Her hair's in a ponytail and she's wearing a
navy blue New Balance cap. The moment I spot her, my teeth finally stop
chattering. She sidles up beside me and looks me over carefully, like she's
checking out the teeth of some dog she's about to buy. She lets out a sound
halfway between a sigh and actual words, then lightly pats me twice on the
shoulder. "Come on, " she says.
Her apartment's two blocks from the Lawson's. A tacky, two-story build­
ing. She walks upstairs, takes the keys out of her pocket, and opens the green
paneled door. The apartment consists of two rooms plus a kitchen and a bath­
room. The walls are thin, the floors creak, and probably the only natural light
the place gets during the day is when the blinding sunset shines in. I hear a
toilet flush in some other unit, the scrape of a cabinet being shut somewhere.
Seedy, all right, but at least it has the feel of real people living real lives.

68

Dishes piled up in the kitchen sink, empty plastic bottles, half-read maga­
zines, past-their-prime potted tulips, a shopping list taped to the fridge, stock­
ings hanging over the back of a chair, newspaper on the table opened to the
1V schedule, an ashtray, a thin box of Virginia Slims. For some strange rea­

son this scene relaxes me.
"This is my friend's apartment, " she explains. "She used to work with me
at a salon in Tokyo, but last year she had to come back to Takamatsu, where
she's from. But then she said she wanted to travel to India for a month and
asked me to watch the place. I'm taking over her job while she's gone. She's a
hairdresser too. I figured it's a good change of pace to get out of Tokyo for a
while. She's one of those New Age types, so I doubt she'll be able to pull her­
self away from India in a month. "
She has me sit down at the dining table, and brings me a can of Pepsi
from the fridge. No glass, though. Normally I don't drink colas-way too
sweet and bad for your teeth. But I'm dying of thirst and down the whole can.
"You want anything to eat? All I've got is Cup Noodle, if that'll do. "
I'm okay, I tell her.
"You look awful. You know that? "
I nod.
"So what happened? "
"I wish I knew. "
"You have no idea what happened. You didn't even know where you
were. And it's a long story, " she says, pinning down the facts. "But you're defi­
nitely in trouble? "
"Definitely, " I reply. I hope that, at least, gets through.
Silence. All the while, she's bathing me in a deep frown. "You don't
really have any relatives in Takamatsu, do you? You ran away from home. "
Again I nod.
"Once, when I was your age, I ran away from home. I think I understand
what you're going through. That's why I gave you my cell phone number.
I figured it might come in handy. "
"I really appreciate it, " I say.
"I lived in Ichikawa, in Chiba. I never got along with my parents and
hated school, so I stole some money from my folks and took off, trying to get
as far away as I could. I was sixteen. I got as far as Abashiri, up in Hokkaido. I
stopped by a farm I happened to see and asked them to let me work there. I'll
do anything, I told them, and I'll work hard. I don't need any pay, as long as
there's a roof over my head and you feed me. The lady there was nice to me,
had me sit down and have some tea. Just wait here, she said. The next thing

1 knew a patrol car pulled up outside and the police were hauling me back

home. This wasn't the first time the lady had gone through this sort of thing.
The thought hit me hard then that 1 had to learn a trade,so no matter where
1 went 1 could always find work. So 1 quit high school,went to a trade school,

and became a hairdresser. " The edges of her lips rise a bit in a faint smile.
"A pretty sound approach to things,don't you think? "
1 agree with her.

"Hey, would you tell me the whole story,from the beginning? " she says,
pulling out a cigarette and lighting it. "I don't think I'm going to get much
more sleep tonight,so 1 might as well hear it all. "
1 explain everything to her, from the time 1 left home. 1 leave out the

omen part,though. That, 1 know,1 can't tell just anyone.

Chapter 10

I

s it all right, then, if Nakata calls you Kawamura?" He repeated the ques­
tion to the striped brown cat, enunciating his words slowly, making it as
easy to understand as he could.
This particular cat had said he thought he had run across Coma, the miss­

ing one-year-old tortoiseshell, in this vicinity. But from Nakata's viewpoint, he
spoke very strangely. The feeling was mutual, for the cat seemed to be having
its own problems following him. Their conversation was at cross purposes.
"I don't mind at all, the tallest of heads. "
"Pardon me, but Nakata doesn't understand what you're saying. Forgive
me, but I'm not so bright."
"It's a tuna, to the very end. "
"Are you perhaps saying you'd like to eat a tuna?"
"No. The hands tied up, before. "
Nakata never went into these conversations with cats expecting to be able
to easily communicate everything. You have to anticipate a few problems
when cats and humans try to speak to each other. And there was another fac­
tor to consider: Nakata's own basic problems with talking-not just with cats,
but also with people. His easy conversation with Otsuka the previous week
was more the exception than the rule, for invariably getting across even a
simple message took a great deal of effort. On bad days it was more like two
people on the opposite shores of a canal yelling to each other on a windy day.
And today was one of those days.
He wasn't sure why, but striped brown cats were the hardest to get on the
same wavelength with. With black cats things mostly went well. Communi­
cating with Siamese cats was the easiest of all, but unfortunately there weren't
too many stray Siamese wandering the streets, so the chance didn't present
itself often. Siamese were mainly kept at home, well taken care of. And for
some reason striped brown cats made up the bulk of the strays.
Even knowing what to expect, Nakata found Kawamura impossible to

decipher. He enunciated his words poorly, and Nakata couldn't catch what
each one meant,or the connection between them. What the cat said came off
sounding more like riddles than sentences. Still,Nakata was infinitely patient,
and had plenty of time on his hands. He repeated the same question,over and
over, having the cat repeat his responses. The two of them were seated on a
boundary stone marking a little park for children in a residential area. They'd
been talking for nearly an hour,going round and round in circles.

"Kawamura is just a name I'll call you. It doesn't mean anything. Nakata
gives names to each cat so it's easy to remember. It won't cause you any prob­
lems, I guarantee it. I'd just like to call you that,if you don't mind. "
In response Kawamura kept muttering something incomprehensible,
and seeing as how this wasn't likely to stop anytime soon Nakata interrupted,
trying to move their talk along by showing Kawamura the photo of Coma
once more.
"Mr. Kawamura,this is Coma. The cat that Nakata is looking for. A one­
year-old tortoiseshell cat. She's owned by the Koizumis of the 3-chome neigh­
borhood in Nogata,who lost track of her a while back. Mrs. Koizumi opened
a window and the cat leaped out and ran away. So once more I'd like to ask
you,have you seen this cat? "
Kawamura gazed at the photograph again and nodded.
"If it's tuna, Kwa'mura tied. Tied up,try to find. "
''I'm sorry,but as I said a moment ago,Nakata is not very bright,and can't
understand very well what you're getting at. Would you mind repeating that? "
"If it's tuna, Kwa'mura tries. Try to find and tied it up. "
"By

tuna, you mean the fish? "

"Tries the tuna,tie it, Kwa'mura. "
Nakata rubbed his closely cropped,salt-and-pepper hair and puzzled this
over. What could he possibly do to solve this tuna riddle and escape from the
maze the conversation had become? No matter how much he put his mind to
it, however, he was clueless. Puzzling things out logically, after all, wasn't
exactly his forte. Totally blithe to it all, Kawamura lifted a rear leg and gave
the spot just below his chin a good scratch.
Just then Nakata thought he heard a small laugh behind him. He turned
and saw,seated on a low concrete wall next to a house,a lovely,slim Siamese
looking at him with narrowed eyes.
"Excuse me, but would you by chance be Mr. Nakata? " the Siamese
purred.
"Yes,that's correct. My name's Nakata. It's very nice to meet you. "
"Likewise, I'm sure," the Siamese replied.

"It's been cloucly since this morning, but I don't expect we'll be seeing
any rain soon," Nakata said.
"I do hope the rain holds off."
The Siamese was a female, just approaching middle age. She proudly
held her tail up straight, and had a collar with a name tag. She had pleasant
features and was slim, with not an ounce of extra fat.
"Please call me Mimi. The Mimi from

La Boheme. There's a song about

it, too: 'Si, Mi Chiamano Mimi.' "
"I see," Nakata said, not really following.
"An opera by Puccini, you know. ]\11' O\vner happens to be a great fan of
opera," Mimi said, and smiled amiably. "I'd sing it for you, but unfortunately
I'm not much of a singer."
"Nakata's very happy to meet you, Mimi-san."
"Same for me, Mr. Nakata."
"Do you live near here?"
"Yes, in that two-story house over there. The Tanabes' house. You see it,
right?The one with the cream-colored BMW 530 parked in front?"
"I see, " Nakata repeated. He had no idea what a BMW was, but he did
spot a cream-colored car. That must be what she meant.
"Mr. Nakata," Mimi said, "I'm known as self-reliant, or perhaps you'd say
a very private sort of cat, and I don't normally interfere in others' affairs. But
that youngster-the one I believe you're referring to as Kawamura?-is not
what I would call the brightest kitty in the litter. When he was still young a
child hit him with his bicycle, the poor thing, and he struck his head against
some concrete. Ever since then he hasn't made much sense. So even if you
are patient with him, as I see you've been, you won't get anywhere. I've been
watching for a while, and I'm afraid I couldn't just sit idly by. I know it's for­
ward of me to do so, but I had to say something."
"No, please don't think that. I'm very happy you told me. Nakata's as
dumb as Kawamura, I'm afraid, and can't get by without other people's help.
That's why I get a sub

city from the Governor every month. So I'm very happy

to hear your opinion, Mimi."
"I take it you're looking for a cat," Mimi said. "I wasn't eavesdropping,
mind you, but just happened to overhear you as I was taking a nap here.
Goma, I believe you said the name was?"
"Yes, that's correct."
"And Kawamura has seen Goma?"
"That's what he told me. But Nakata can't figure out what he said
after that."

73

"If you wouldn't mind, Mr. Nakata, why don't I step in and try to talk
with him? It's easier for two cats to communicate, and I'm fairly used to the
way he talks. So why don't I sound him out, then summarize it for you? "
"That would be very helpful, I'm sure."
The Siamese nodded lightly, and like a ballet dancer nimbly leaped
down from the concrete wall. Black tail held up high like a flagstaff, she
leisurely walked over and sat down beside Kawamura. He immediately began
to sniff Mimi's rump, but the Siamese gave him a swift blow to the cheek and
the younger cat shrank back. With barely a pause Mimi dealt him another
blow to the nose.
"Now pay attention, you brainless dingbat! You stinky good-for-nothing! "
Mimi hissed, then turned to Nakata. "You've got to show him who's in charge
up front or you'll never get anywhere. Otherwise he'll go all spacey on you,
and all you get is drivel. It's not his fault he's this way, and I do feel sorry for
him, but what are you going to do? "
"I see, " Nakata said, not at all sure what he was agreeing to.
The two cats began conversing, but they spoke so quickly and softly that
Nakata wasn't able to catch any of it. Mimi grilled Kawamura in a sharp tone,
the younger cat replying timidly. Any hesitation got him another merciless
slap to the face. This Siamese cat was clever, and educated too. Nakata had
met many cats up till this point, but never before one who listened to opera
and knew models of cars. Impressed, he watched as Mimi went about her
business with a brisk efficiency.
Once Mimi had heard everything she wanted to, she chased the younger
cat off. "Be on your way! " she said sharply, and he dejectedly slunk away.
Mimi affably nestled up into Nakata's lap. "I think I've got the gist of it. "
"Much obliged, " Nakata said.
"That cat-Kawamura, that is-said he's seen Coma several times in a
grassy spot just down the road. It's an empty lot they were planning to build
on. A real estate firm bought up a car company's parts warehouse and tore it
down, planning to put up a high-class condo. A citizens' movement's opposed
the development, there was a legal battle, and the construction's been put on
hold. The sort of thing that happens all the time these days. The lot's over­
grown with grass and people hardly ever come there, so it's the perfect hang­
out for all the strays in the neighborhood. I don't keep company with many
cats, and I don't want to get fleas, so I hardly ever go over there. As you're no
doubt aware, fleas are like a bad habit-awfully hard to get rid of once you
get them. "
"I see, " Nakata said.

74

"He told me the cat's just like the one in the photograph-a timid, pretty
young tortoiseshell with a flea collar. Can't seem to speak that well, either. It's
clear to anyone that it's a naive house cat that can't find its way back home. "
"When was this, I wonder?"
"The last time he saw the cat seems to be three or four days ago. He's not
very bright, so he's not even sure about days. But he did say it was the day after
it rained, so I'm thinking it must have been Monday. I seem to recall it rained
pretty hard on Sunday. "
"Nakata doesn't know about the days of the week, but I think it did rain
around then. He hasn't seen her since?"
"That was the last time. The other cats haven't seen her either, he says.
He's a spacey, good-far-nothing cat, but I pressed him closely and believe
most of what he says. "
"I really want to thank you. "
"No need-it was my pleasure. Most of the time I have only this worth­
less bunch of cats around here to talk to, and we never seem to agree on any­
thing. I find it incredibly irritating. So it's a breath of fresh air to be able to
talk with a sensible human such as yourself. "
"I see, " Nakata said. "There's one thing Nakata still doesn't understand.
Mr. Kawamura kept going on about

tuna, and I was wondering if he meant

the fish?"
Mimi lithely lifted her left front leg, inspecting the pink flesh of the pad,
and chuckled. "The youngster's terminology isn't very extensive, I'm afraid. "

"Termanolgy ?"
"The number of words he's familiar with is limited, is what I'm saying. So
for him everything that's good to eat is

tuna. For him tuna's the creme de la

creme, as far as food goes. He doesn't know there are such things as sea
bream, halibut, or yellowtail. "
Nakata cleared his throat. "Actually, Nakata's very fond of tuna. Of
course I like eel as well. "
'Tm fond of eel myself. Though it's not the sort of thing you can eat all
the time . "
"That's true. You couldn't eat it all the time. "
The two of them were silent for a time, eel musings filling the passing
moments.
"Anyway, what that cat was getting at is this, " Mimi said, as if suddenly
remembering. "Not long after the neighborhood cats began hanging out at
that vacant lot, a bad person showed up who catches cats. The other cats
believe this man may have taken Coma away. The man lures them with

75

something good to eat,then throws them inside a large sack. The man's quite
skilled at catching cats, and a hungry,innocent cat like Coma would easily
fall into his trap. Even the stray cats who live around here, normally a wary
bunch, have lost a couple of their number to this man. It's simply hideous,
because nothing could be worse for a cat than to be stuffed inside a bag. "
"I see," Nakata said, and again rubbed his salt-and-pepper hair with his
palm. "But what does this man do with the cats once he's caught them? "
"That I don't know. In the old days they used to make shamisens out of
cat skin,but nowadays not too many people play the shamisen. And besides,I
hear they mainly use plastic now. In some parts of the world people eat cats,
though not in Japan,thank goodness. So I think we can exclude both of these
as motives. Which leaves, let me see . . . people who use cats in scientific
experiments. Cats are used a lot in experiments. One of my friends, in fact,
was used in a psychology experiment at Tokyo University. A terrible thing,but
it's a long story and I won't go into it now. There are also perverts-not many,
mind you-who just enjoy tormenting cats. Catching a cat and chopping off
its tail,for instance. "
"What do they do after they chop it off? "
"Nothing. They just want to torment and hurt the cats. Makes them feel
good for some reason. I'm afraid there are twisted people like that in the
world. "
Nakata gave this some thought. How could chopping off a cat's tail pos­
sibly be fun? "So what you're saying is that maybe this

twisted person has

taken Coma away? " he asked.
Mimi screwed up her long white whiskers and frowned. "I'd rather not
think that,or even imagine it,but it

is a possibility. Mr. Nakata, I haven't lived

all that many years, but I've seen terrible things I never could have imagined.
Most people look at cats and think what

a life -all we do is lie around in the

sun, never having to lift a finger. But cats' lives aren't that idyllic. Cats are
powerless, weak little creatures that injure easily. We don't have shells like
turtles, nor wings like birds. We can't burrow into the ground like moles or
change colors like a chameleon. The world has no idea how many cats are
injured every day,how many of us meet a miserable end. I happen to be lucky
enough to live with the Tanabes in a warm and friendly family,the children
treat me well, and I've got everything I need. But even my life isn't always
easy. When it comes to strays,though, they have a very tough time of it. "
"You're really smart, aren't you, Mimi? " Nakata said, impressed by the
Siamese's eloquence.
"No,not really," Mimi replied,narrowing her eyes in embarrassment. "I

just spend too much time lying in front of the 1V and this is what happens­
my head gets full of worthless facts. Do you ever watch 1V, Mr. Nakata? "
"No, Nakata doesn't watch 1V. The people on 1V talk too fast, and I
can't keep up with them. I'm dumb,so I can't read,and if you can't read 1V
doesn't make much sense. Sometimes I listen to the radio, but the words
there are also too fast, and it tires me out. I much prefer doing this-enjoy
talking with a cat outside,under the sky. "
"Indeed," Mimi said.
"That's right," Nakata replied.
"I really hope that Coma is all right. "
"Mimi, Nakata's going to have a look at that empty lot. "
"According to the youngster,this man is very tall,and wears a strange tall
hat and long leather boots. And he walks fast. He looks very unusual,so you'll
recognize him right away, he told me. Whenever the cats that gather at the
empty lot see him coming, they scatter in all directions. But a newcomer
might not know enough to. . . . "
Nakata stored this information away in his head, carefully folding it all
away in a front drawer so he wouldn't forget it.

The man is very tall, and wears

a strange tall hat and long leather boots . . . .
"I hope I've been of help," Mimi said.
"Nakata appreciates everything you've done. If you hadn't been kind
enough to speak up I'd still be going round and round about tuna. I'm
grateful. "
"What I think," Mimi said,gazing up at Nakata with knit brows, "is that
that man is

trouble. A lot of trouble. He's more dangerous than you can ever

imagine. If it were me I'd never go near that lot. But you're a human,and it's
your job,after all,but I hope you'll take every precaution. "
"Thank you very kindly. I'll be as careful as I can. "
"Mr. Nakata, this world is a terribly violent place. And nobody can
escape the violence. Please keep that in mind. You can't be too cautious. The
same holds true for cats and human beings. "
'Til remember that," Nakata replied.
But he had no idea where and how the world could be violent. The
world was full of things Nakata couldn't comprehend, and most things
connected with violence fell into that category.

After saying good-bye to Mimi, he went to see the empty lot, which turned
out to be about the size of a small playground. A tall plywood fence enclosed

77

the lot, with a sign on it saying

KEEP OUT: SITE OF FUTURE CONSTRUCTION

(which Nakata,naturally,couldn't read). A heavy chain blocked the entrance,
but around back was a gap in the fence, and he easily got inside. Someone
must have pried it open.
All the warehouses that had originally stood there had been torn down,
but the land hadn't been graded for construction and was covered with grass.
Goldenrod grew as high as a child,a couple of butterflies flickering above it.
Mounds of earth had hardened in the rain,in some places rising up in little
hillocks. A perfect place for cats. People wouldn't come in,and there were all
sorts of little creatures to catch and plenty of places to hide.
Kawamura was nowhere to be seen. Two scrawny cats with rough coats
were there,but when Nakata called out a friendly greeting they just glanced
at him coldly and disappeared into the weeds. Which made sense-none of
them wanted to get caught and have his tail chopped off. Nakata himself
certainly didn't want to have that happen to him,not that he had a tail. It was
no wonder the cats were wary of him.
Nakata stood on higher ground and took a good look around. No one
else was there, just the butterflies,searching for something, fluttering above
the weeds. He found a good spot to sit down,lowered his canvas bag from his
shoulder,took out two bean-jam buns,and had his llsual lunch. He drank hot
tea from a thermos,eyes narrowed as he quietly sipped. Just a quiet early after­
noon. Everything was at rest, placid, harmonious. Nakata found it hard to
believe that somebody might be lying in wait to torment and torture cats.
He rubbed his cropped salt-and-pepper hair as he chewed. If somebody
else was with him he could explain-N aka ta 's

not very bright-but unfortu­

nately he was alone. All he could do was nod a few times to himself and con­
tinue chewing. Once he finished the buns he folded up the cellophane
they'd been wrapped in into a compact square and put it in his bag. He
screwed the lid back on the thermos tight and put it in his bag as well. The
sky was covered with a layer of clouds, but from their color he could tell
the sun was almost directly overhead.

The man is very tall, and wears a strange tall hat and long leather boots.
Nakata tried to picture this man,but had no idea what a strange tall hat
and long leather boots looked like. In his whole life he'd never encountered
any tall hats and long leather boots. Kawamura had told Mimi that you'd
know him when you saw him. So, Nakata decided,I suppose I'll just have to
wait until I see him. That's definitely the best plan. He stood up and relieved
himself in the weeds-a long,honest pee-and then went over to a clump of
weeds in a corner of the vacant lot,where he had the best chance of remain-

ing hidden from sight, and sat out the rest of the afternoon, waiting for that
strange man to show up.
Waiting was a boring task. He had no clue when the man might next
appear-maybe tomorrow, maybe not for a week. Or maybe he'd never show
up again-there was that possibility. But Nakata was used to aimless waiting
and spending time alone, doing nothing. He wasn't bothered in the least.
Time wasn't the main issue for him. He didn't even own a watch. Nakata
operated on his own sense of time. In the morning it got light, in the evening
the sun set and it got dark. Once it got dark he'd go to the nearby public bath,
and after coming home from his bath he'd go to sleep. The public bath was
closed on certain days of the week, and when that happened he'd just give up
and go back home. His stomach told him when it was time to eat, and when
the time came for him to go pick up his

sub city (somebody was always nice

enough to tell him when that day was near) he knew another month had
passed. The next day he'd always go for a haircut at the local barber shop.
Every summer someone from the ward office would treat him to eel, and
every New Year they'd bring him rice cakes.
Nakata let his body relax, switched off his mind, allowing things to flow
through him. This was natural for him, something he'd done ever since he
was a child, without a second thought. Before long the borders of his con­
sciousness fluttered around, just like the butterflies. Beyond these borders lay
a dark abyss. Occasionally his consciousness would fly over the border and
hover over that dizzying, black crevass. But Nakata wasn't afraid of the dark­
ness or how deep it was. And why should he be? That bottomless world of
darkness, that weighty silence and chaos, was an old friend, a part of him
already. Nakata understood this well. In that world there was no writing, no
days of the week, no scary Governor, no opera, no BMWs. No scissors, no tall
hats. On the other hand, there was also no delicious eel, no tasty bean-jam
buns.

Everything is there, but there are no parts. Since there are no parts,

there's no need to replace one thing with another. No need to remove any­
thing, or add anything. You don't have to think about difficult things, just let
yourself soak it all in. For Nakata, nothing could be better.
Occasionally he dozed off. Even when he slept, though, his senses, ever
vigilant, kept watch over the vacant lot. If something happened, if somebody
came, he could wake up and do what needed to be done. The sky was cov­
ered with a flat line of gray clouds, but at least it wasn't going to rain. The cats
all knew it. And so did Nakata.

Chapter 11

W

hen I finish talking it's pretty late. Sakura listens intently the
whole time,resting her head in her hands on the kitchen table. I
tell her that I'm actually fifteen, in junior high, that I stole my

father's money and ran away from my home in Nakano Ward in Tokyo. That
I'm staying in a hotel in Takamatsu and spending my days reading at a library.
That all of a sudden I found myself collapsed outside a shrine, covered with
blood. Everything. Well, almost everything. Not the important stuff I can't
talk about.
"So your mother left home with your older sister when you were just
four. Leaving you and your father behind. "
I take the photo of my sister and me at the shore from my wallet and show
her. "This is my sister," I say. Sakura looks at the photo for a while,then hands
it back without a word.
"I haven't seen her since then," I say. "Or my mom. She's never gotten in
touch,and I have no idea where she is. I don't even remember what she looks
like. There aren't any photos of her left. I remember her smell,her touch,but
not her face. "
"Hmm," Sakura says. Head still in her hands, she narrows her eyes and
looks at me. "Must have been hard on you. "
"Yeah,I guess. . . . "
She continues to gaze at me silently. "So you didn't get along with your
dad? " she asks after a while.

Didn't get along? How am I supposed to answer that? I don't say any­
thing,just shake my head.
"Dumb question-of course you didn't. Otherwise you wouldn't have
run away," Sakura says. "So anyway,you left your home, and today you sud­
denly lost consciousness or your memory or something. "
"Yeah. "
"Did that ever happen before?"

80

"Sometimes, " I tell her honestly. "I fly into a rage, and it's like I blow a
fuse. Like somebody pushes a switch in my head and my body does its thing
before my mind can catch up. It's like I'm here, but in a way it's not me. "
"You lose control and do something violent, you mean?"
"It's happened a few times, yeah. "
"Have you hurt anybody?"
I nod. "Twice I did. Nothing serious."
She thinks about this.
"Is that what happened this time?"
I shake my head. "This is the first time something this bad's happened.
This time . . . I don't know how it started, and I can't remember at all what
happened. It's like my memory was wiped clean. It never was this bad
before. "
She looks over the T-shirt I haul out of my backpack, carefully checking
the blood I couldn't wash out. "So the last thing you remember is eating
dinner, right?At a restaurant near the station?"
I nod.
"And everything after that's a blank. The next thing you knew, you were
lying in the bushes behind that shrine. About four hours later. Your shirt cov­
ered in blood and your left shoulder aching?"
I give her another nod. She brings over a city map from somewhere and
checks out the distance between the station and the shrine.
"It's not so far, but it would take a while to walk. But why would you have
been over there in the first place?It's the opposite direction from your hotel.
Have you ever gone there before?"
"Never. "
"Take off your shirt for a minute, " she says.
I strip bare to the waist, and she walks behind me and grabs my left shoul­
der hard. Her fingers dig into my flesh, and I can't help but gasp. This girl's
pretty strong.
"Does it hurt?"
"You bet it does, " I say.
"You hit something pretty hard. Or something hit you. "
"I don't remember a thing. "
"Anyway, nothing's broken, " she says. She proceeds to prod around the
sore spot, and aside from the pain, her fingers feel really nice. When I tell her
so she smiles.
'Tve always been good at giving massages. It's a useful skill for a hair­
dresser. "

She keeps on massaging my shoulder. "Doesn't look like anything major.
Give it a good night's sleep and you should feel better. "
She picks up my T-shirt, puts it in a plastic bag, and tosses it in the
garbage. My dungaree shirt she gives a once-over and throws in the washing
machine. She rummages around in her dresser and comes up with a white
T-shirt. She hands it to me, a brand-new white shirt that says

Maui W hale

Watching Cruise on it,with a picture of a fluke sticking out of the water.
"This is the biggest shirt I could find. It's not mine, but don't worry
about it. It's just a souvenir from somebody. Might not be your style,but give
it a try. "
I tug the shirt on,and it fits perfectly.
"You can keep it if you want," she says.
I thank her.
"So you never had such a total memory loss before? " she asks.
I nod, then close my eyes, feeling the T-shirt, taking in its new smell.
"Sakura, I'm really scared," I tell her. "I don't know what to do. I don't have
any memory of hurting anybody. Whatever it was got me covered in blood,
but I can't remember anything. If I committed a crime, I'm still legally
responsible,right,whether I have a memory of it or not? "
"Maybe it was just a nosebleed. Somebody was walking down the street,
bumped into a telephone pole, and got a bloody nose. And all you did was
help them out. See? I understand why you're worried,but let's try not to think
about worst-case scenarios,okay? At least not tonight. In the morning we can
look in the paper, watch the news on TV. If something terrible really hap­
pened, we'll know about it. Then we can consider our options. There're
plenty of reasons why someone might get bloody,and most of the time it's not
nearly as bad as it looks. I'm a girl, so I'm used to seeing blood

-

1 see that

much every month. You know what 1 mean? "
I nod,and feel myself blushing a little. She scoops a little Nescafe into a
big cup and heats up some water in a small pan. She smokes, waiting for the
water to boil. She takes a couple of puffs,then extinguishes the cigarette with
tap water. 1 catch a whiff of menthol.
"I don't mean to pry, but there's something I want to ask you. Do you
mind? "
"I don't mind," I tell her.
"Your older sister was adopted. They got her from somewhere before you
were born,right? "
'That's right," I reply. "I don't know why, but my parents adopted her.
After that 1 was born. Not exactly what they had in mind, 1 imagine. "

"So you're definitely the child of your mother and father. "
"As far I know," I tell her.
"But when your mother left, she didn't take you, but took your sister,
who's unrelated to her," Sakura says. "Not what you'd normally expect a
woman to do. "
I don't say anything.
"Why'd she do that? "
I shake my head. "I have no idea," I tell her. 'Tve asked myself the same
question a million times. "
"That must have hurt. "
Did it? "I don't know. But if I get married someday I don't think I'll have
any kids. I wouldn't have any idea how to get along with them if I did. "
"My situation wasn't as complicated as yours," she says, "but I didn't get
along with my folks for a long time, and I got mixed up in a lot of stupid
things because of it. So I know how you feel. But it's not a good idea to make
decisions so soon. There's no such thing as absolutes."
She stands in front of the kitchen stove and sips her Nescafe,steam rising
from the large cup. The cup has a drawing of the Moomin cartoon characters
on it. She doesn't say anything,and neither do I.
"Do you have anybody, relatives or someone, who can help? " she asks
after a while.
"No," I say. "My father's parents died a long time ago, and he doesn't
have any brothers, sisters, uncles, or aunts. Not a one. Not that I can prove
this. But I do know he never had anything to do with any relatives. And I
never heard anything about relatives on my mother's side. I mean, I don't
even know my mother's name-so how was I supposed to know about her
relatives? "
"Your father sounds like an alien from outer space or something," Sakura
says. "Like he came from some far-off planet, took on human form, kid­
napped an Earth woman, and then had you. Just so he could have more
descendants. Your mother found out, got frightened, and ran away. Like in
some film noir science-fiction flick. "
I have no idea what to say.
"All joking aside," she says, and smiles broadly to show that she means
it, "my point is,in this whole wide world the only person you can depend on
"
is you.
"I guess so. "
She stands there leaning against the sink,drinking her coffee.
"I have to get some sleep, " she says, as if suddenly remembering. It's past

three. "I have to get up at seven-thirty so I won't get much, but a little's better
than none. I hate going to work on no sleep at all. So what're you going
to do? "
"I have my sleeping bag with me, " I tell her, "so if it's no bother I'll just
sack out in a corner. " I take my tightly rolled-up sleeping bag out of my back­
pack, spread it out, and fluff it up.
She watches, impressed. "A regular Boy Scout, " she says.

After she turns out the light and gets in bed, I climb into my sleeping bag,
shut my eyes, and try to go to sleep. But I can't stop picturing that bloody
white T-shirt. I still feel that burning sensation in my palm. I open my eyes
and stare at the ceiling. A floor creaks somewhere. Somebody turns on a
faucet. And again I hear an ambulance in the night, far off but echoing
sharply in the darkness.
"Can't fall asleep? " she whispers in the dark.
"No, " I say.
"Me neither. Shouldn't have had that coffee. That was dumb. " She
switches on her bedside light, checks the time, then turns the light off. "Don't
get me wrong, " she says, "but if you'd like to come over here you can. I can't
get to sleep either. "
I slip out of my sleeping bag and climb in bed with her. I'm wearing
boxers and the T-shirt. She has on a pair of light pink pajamas.
"I have a steady boyfriend in Tokyo, " she tells me. "He's not much to brag
about, but he's my guy. So I don't have sex with anybody else. I might not
look like it, but when it comes to sex I'm pretty straightlaced. Call me old­
fashioned. I wasn't always that way-I used to be pretty wild-but I don't fool
around anymore. So don't get any ideas, okay? Just think of us as brother and
sister. You understand? "
"Gotcha, " I tell her.
She puts her arms around me, hugs me close, and rests her cheek on my
forehead. "You poor thing, " she says.
I don't need to tell you that I get a hard-on right away. Big time. And it
couldn't help rubbing up against her thigh.
"My oh my!" she says.
"Sorry, " I tell her. "I didn't mean to. "
"It's okay, " she says. "I know what an inconvenience it is. Nothing you
can do to stop it. "
I nod in the darkness.

She hesitates for a moment, then lowers my boxers, pulls out my rock­
hard cock, and cradles it gently in her hand. Like she's making sure of some­
thing, the way a doctor takes a pulse. With her soft hand touching me, 1 feel
something-a stray thought, maybe - spring up in my crotch.
"How old would your sister be now? "
"Twenty-one, " 1 say. "Six years older than me. "
She thinks about this for a while. "Do you want to see her? "
"Maybe, " 1 say.

"Ma y be?" Her hand grasps my cock a little harder. "What do you mean,
ma ybe? You really don't want to see her that much? "
"I don't know what we'd talk about, and she might not want to see me.
Same thing with m y mother. Maybe neither one o f them wants t o have any­
thing to do with me. No one's searching for me. I mean, they left and every­
thing. "

W ithout me, I silently complete the thought.

She doesn't say anything. Her hand on my cock loosens a bit, then
tightens. In time with this my cock relaxes, then gets even harder.
"You want to come? " she asks.
"Maybe, " I say.
"Again with the

ma y bes?"

"Very much, " 1 correct myself.
She sighs lightly and slowly begins to move her hand. It feels out of this
world. Not just an up-and-down motion, but more of an all-over massage.
Her fingers gently stroke my cock and my balls. I close my eyes and let out a
big sigh.
"You can't touch me. And when you're about to come let me know so you
don't mess up the sheets."
"Okay, " I say.
"How is it? I'm pretty good, huh? "
"Fantastic. "
"Like I was telling you, I'm very nimble-fingered. But this isn't sex, okay?
I'm just-helping you relax, is what it is. You've had a rough day, you're
all tense, and you're not going to sleep well unless we do something about it.
Got it? "
"Yeah, I get it, " 1 say. "But I do have one request. "
"What's that? "
"Is it okay if I imagine you naked? "
Her hand stops and she looks me in the eyes. "You want to imagine me
naked while we're doing this? "
"Yeah. I've been trying to keep from imagining that, but I can't. "

"Really? "
"It's like a TV you can't turn off. "
She laughs. "I don't get it. You didn't have to tell rne that! Why don't you
just go ahead and imagine what you want? You don't need my permission.
How can I know what's in your head? "
"I can't help it. Imagining something's very important, so I thought I'd
better tell you. It has nothing to do with whether you know or not. "
"You are some kind of polite boy, aren't you, " she says, impressed. "I
guess it's nice, though, that you wanted to let me know. All right, permission
granted. Go ahead and picture me nude. "
"Thanks, " I say.
"How is it? Is my body nice? "
"It's amazing, " I reply.
This languid sensation spreads over my lower half, like a liquid floating
to the surface. When I tell her, she grabs some tissue from the bedside, and I
come, over and over, like crazy . . . . A little while later she goes to the kitchen,
tosses away the tissue paper, and rinses her hand.
"Sorry, " I say.
"It's all right, " she says, snuggling back into bed. "No need to apologize.
It's just a part of your body. So-do you feel better? "
"Definitely. "
''I'm glad. " She thinks for a while, then says, "I was thinking how nice it'd
be if I was your real sister. "
"Me too, " I say.
She lightly touches my hair. "I'm going to sleep now, so why don't you go
back to your sleeping bag. I can't sleep well unless I'm alone, and I don't want
your hard-on poking me all night, okay? "
I go back to my sleeping bag and close my eyes. This time I can get to
sleep. A deep, deep sleep, maybe the deepest since I ran away from home. It's
like I'm in some huge elevator that slowly, silently carries me deeper and
deeper underground. Finally all light has disappeared, all sound faded away.

When I wake up, Sakura's gone off to work. It's nine a.m. My shoulder hardly
aches at all anymore. Just like she said. On the kitchen table I find a folded­
LIp morning paper, a note, and a key.
Her note says: I watched the TV news at seven and looked through the
entire paper, but there weren't an y bloody incidents reported around here. So I
don't think that blood was an y thing. Good news, huh? There isn't much in the
86

fridge, but help yourself And make use of whatever you need around the house.
If you aren't plannin g to go anywhere, feel free to hang out here. Just put the
key under the doormat if you go out.
I grab a carton of milk from the fridge, check the exp i ration date, and
pour i t over some cornflakes,boil some water,and make a cup of Darj e e l i n g
tea . Toast two sl i ces of bread, and e a t t h e m with s o m e l ow-fat m a rga ri n e .
Th en I o p e n t h e newspaper a n d scan the local news. Like s h e sa id,n o violent
cri mes i n the headli nes. I let out a sigh of rel ief,fol d up the paper,and put it
back where it was. At least I won't have to ru n all over trying to evade th e
cops. But I decide it's better not to go back to the hotel, j ust to play it safe .
I stil l don't know what happened during those l ost fou r hours.
I call the hote l . A man answers,and I don't recognize h i s voi c e . I tel l h i m
som eth i ng's c o m e up a n d I have to check out. I try m y best t o sou n d grown­
up. I 've paid in adva n c e so that shouldn't be a probl e m . Th ere are some per­
sonal effects i n the room,I tell h i m,but they can be discard e d . He c h ecks the
computer and sees that the b i l l 's up-to-date . "Everyth i ng's i n order, Mr.
Tamur a ," he says. "Yo u 're all ch ecked out." The key's a plastic card,so there's
no need to return it. I thank h i m and hang up.
I take a shower. Sakura 's underwear and stocki ngs are d rying out i n the
bathroom. I try not to look at them and concentrate on my usual j ob of
thoroughly scrubb i n g myself. And I try my best not to th ink about l ast night.
I brush my teeth and put on a pair of new shorts, roll up my sl eeping bag
and stuff i t i n my backpack,th en wash my di rty clothes i n the washer. Th ere's
no dryer,so after they go through the sp in cycle I fol d th e m up and put th e m
in a plastic b a g and into m y pack. I c a n always dry th e m at a coin l a u n d ry
later o n .
I wash all th e dishes p i l e d u p in the sink, l e t th em dra in, dry them, a n d
place them back in the shelf. Then I stra ighten up the contents of t h e fridge
and toss whatever's gone bad. Some of th e food stinks-moldy broccoli, an
ancient, rubbery cucumber, a pack of tofu well past its expiration date . I take
whateve r's still edible, transfer it to new conta iners, and wipe up some spilled
sauce. I throw away all the cigarette butts,make a neat stack of the scattered old
newspapers,and ru n a vacuum around the place. Sakura might be good at giv­
ing a massage, but when it comes to keep ing house she's a disaster. I iron the
sh irts she's crammed in the dresser,and th ink about going shopping and mak­
ing dinner. At home I tried to take care of household ch ores mysel f,so none of
th is is any troubl e . But making dinner,I decide,might be going too far.
F i nished with all that, I sit down at the kitchen table and look around
the apartment. I know I can't stay here forever. I 'd have a semipermanent

h ard-on, with semipermanent fantasies. Can't avoid looking at those tiny
black panties hanging i n the bathroom, can't keep asking her permissi o n
t o let my i magination roam . But most of all I can't forget w h a t s h e did for m e
last night.
I leave a n ote for Sakura, using the blunt pencil and the memo pad
beside the phon e . Thanks. You really saved me. I'm sorry I woke you up so late

last night. But you're the only one I could count on. I stop for a moment to
th ink what I should write next, and do a three-sixty of the room as I ' m th i nk­
ing. Thanks for letting me stay over. I'm grateful you said I could stay here as

long I liked. It would be nice if I could, but I don't think I should bother you
anymore. There're all sorts of reasons I won't go into. I've got to make it on my
own. I hope you'll still think kindly of me the next time I'm in a jam.
I stop aga i n . Someone in the neighborhood's got their TV on at ful l vol­
u me, one of those morning talk shows for housewives. The people on th e
sh ow all yel l i n g at each other,and commercials j ust as loud and obnoxious. I
sit at th e table, spinning the blunt pencil in my hand, pulling my thoughts
together. To tell the truth, though, I don't think I deserve your kindness. I'm try­

ing my best to be a much better person, but things aren't going so well. The next
time we meet I hope I'll have my act together. Whether that will happen or not,
I don't know. Thanks for last night. It was wonderful.
I sl i p the note under a cup, shoulder my backpack, and head out of the
apartment, leaving the key under the doormat l ike she sa i d . A black-a nd­
white spotted cat's lying i n the middle of the sta i rs,taking a nap. He must be
used to people because he doesn 't make a move to get up as I go down th e
sta i rs . I sit down beside h i m and stroke his large body for a w h i l e . The feel of
his fur bri ngs back memories. The cat narrows his eyes and starts to purr. We
sit there on the sta i rs for a long time, each e n j oying h is own version of th is
intimate fee l i ng. Finally I tell him good-bye and walk down the roa d . A fi n e
ra i n 's begun t o fal l .
Having checked o u t o f the hotel a n d left Sakura's, I have n o idea where
I'll spend the night. Before the sun sets I 've got to fi n d a roof to sleep under,
someplace safe . I don't know where to begin but decide to take th e tra i n out
to the Komura Library. Once I get there, someth i n g will work out. I don't
know why,but I j ust have a feeling it wil l .
Fate seems t o b e taking me in some even stranger directions.

Chapter 12

Dear Professor,
I'm sure you must be quite surprised to receive a l etter fro m me, out of the
bl ue. Please forgive m e for being so forward. I imagine that you n o longe r
re member my n a m e , Professor, b u t I was a t one time a teacher a t a small
elementary school i n Ya manash i Prefecture. Wh en you read th is, you may
recall someth i n g about me. I was the teacher in charge of the group of c h i l­
dren on a fi e l d trip, th e ones involved in the i n cident in wh ich th e c h ildren
all lost consciousness. Afterward , as you may remember, I had the oppor­
tunity to speak with you and your coll eagues from the university in Tokyo
several times when you visited our town with people from the m i l itary to
investigate .
I n th e years fol l owing I 've often seen your name mentioned promi­
ne ntly i n the press, and I have followed your career and a c h i eve m e nts with
the deepest a d m i ration. At the same time, I have fond m e mories of when we
met, especially your very businessl ike, brisk way of speaki ng. I feel b lessed ,
too , t o have been able t o read several o f your books. I 've always b e e n i m­
pressed by you r i nsights, and I find the worldview that runs through all of
your publications very convinci ng-namely that as i n dividuals each of us is
extre mely isolate d , wh i l e at the sa me time we are a l l l i nked by a prototyp ical
memory. There have been times i n my own l ife that I felt exactly this way.
From afar, th e n , I pray for your continued success.
Afte r that i ncident I continued to teach at the sam e elementary school.
A few years ago, however, I un expectedly fel l ill, was h ospitalized for a long
spell i n Kofu Gen eral H ospital , and, after some time, submitted my resigna­
tion. For a year I was i n and out of th e hospital , but eventually I recovere d ,
was discharge d , and o p e n e d a s m a l l tutorial school i n our town. M y stude nts

were th e ch ildren of my former pupils. It's a trite observation, perhaps, but it
is true what they say-that time does fly-and I 've found the passage of time
to be incredibly swi ft.
During the war I l ost both my husband and my fath er, then my mother
as well i n the confused period following the surrender. With my husband off
to war soon after we marri ed, we never had any c h i ldren, so I 've been all
alone i n the world. I wouldn't say my l i fe has been happy, but it has been a
great blessi ng to have been able to teach for so long and have the chance to
work with so many c h ildren over the years. I thank God for th is opportunity.
I f it hadn't been for teaching I don't th ink I 'd have been able to su rvive.
I summoned up my courage today to write to you, Professor, because
I 've never been able to forget that incident in the woods i n th e fal l of 1944.
Twenty-eight years have passed, but to me it's as fresh in my mind as if it
took place yesterday. Th ose memories are always with m e, shadowing my
every waking moment. I 've spent countless sleepl ess n ights pondering it all,
and it's even haunted my dreams.
I t's as if the aftershocks of that incident affect every aspect of my l i fe. To
give you an example, wh enever I run ac ross any of the children i nvolved i n
t h e incident (half of wh om still l ive here i n town and a r e n o w i n th eir m i d­
th i rti es) I always wonder what effects the incident had on th em, and o n
myself. Someth i n g as trau matic a s that you 'd th ink w o u l d have t o h a v e som e
l i ngering physical or psychological impact on all of us. I c a n ' t believe other­
wise. But when it comes to pinpointing what sort of effects these were, and
how great a n impact i t all had, I ' m at a loss.
As you 're well aware, Professor, the mil itary kept n ews of th is i n cident
fro m reaching the publ i c. During the Occupation the American m i l i ta ry
conducted their own investigation behind cl osed doors. The m i l itary's
always th e same, whether Japanese or American. Even when censorsh i p
w a s l ifted after t h e Occ upation, no arti cles a b o u t t h e i n c i d e n t appeared i n
newspapers or magaz i n es. Wh ich I suppose is understandable, s i n c e i t h a d
taken p l a c e years before a n d no o n e h a d died.
Because of th is, most people are unaware that such an i n cident ever
took place. During the war there were so many horrific events, and m i l l ions
of people lost their l ives, so I don't suppose people would be very shocked by
what happened i n our l i ttle town. Even here not many people remember
what happen ed, and those who do don't appear will ing to talk about it.
I 'd say most people who recall the incident find it an unpleasant memory
they'd prefe r not to touch on.
Most th i ngs are forgotten over time. Even the war itself, the l i fe-and-

death struggle people went through , is now l ike someth ing fro m th e distant
past. We 're so caught up i n our everyday l ives that events of the past, l ike
ancient stars that have burned out, are no longer i n orbit around o u r m i nds.
There are j u st too many th ings we have to think about every day, too many
new th ings we h ave to learn . New styles, new informatio n , new technology,
new terminology . . . B ut sti l l , no matter how much time passes, no m atte r
what takes place i n th e i nteri m , there a r e some th ings we can n e v e r assign
to oblivi o n , m emories we can never rub away. They rema i n with us forever,
l ike a touchstone. And for m e , what happened i n the woods that day is one
of these.
I realize there's n oth ing I can do about it now, and I would c e rta inly
understand i f you are puzzled about why I ' m bringing th is up at this late
date. B ut wh i l e I ' m sti l l al ive there's someth ing I have to get off my chest.
During the war, of course , we l ived under strict censorsh i p , a n d there
were thin gs we couldn't easily talk about. When I m et you , Professor, there
were m i l itary officers with us and I couldn't speak freely. Also , I d i d n 't know
anyth ing about you the n , or about your work, so I certa inly didn't feel - as a
young woman talking to a man she didn't know - I could be candid about
any private m atter. Thus I kept several facts to mysel f. I n oth e r words, i n the
official i nvestigation I i ntenti onally changed some of the facts about the
incident. And whe n , after the war, the American m i l itary i nterviewed m e ,
I stuck t o my story. O u t of fea r a n d t o keep up appearances, perhaps, I
repeated the sam e l ies I 'd told you. This may well have made it m o re dif­
ficult for you to i nvestigate the incident, and may have somewhat skewed
your conclusions. No, I know it did. This has bothered m e for years, and
I ' m ashamed of what I did.
I hope th is exp l a i ns why I 've written this long l etter to you. I rea l i z e
you're a busy m a n and m a y n o t have time for th is. I f so , please fee l free to
treat it a l l as the ram b l i ngs of an old woman and toss the l etter away. The
th ing is, I feel th e need, wh i l e I'm sti ll able, to confess all that really took
place the n , write it down , and pass it along to someone who sho u l d know.
I recovered fro m my i l l ness, but you never know when th ere might be a
relapse. I hope you will take this i nto consideration.
The night before I took the c h i ldren up into the h ills, I had a dream about
my husband, j ust before dawn. H e had been drafted and was off at war. The
dream was extremely real istic and sexually charged - one of those dreams
that's so vivid it's hard to distinguish between dream and reality.
I n the dream we were lying on a large flat rock having sex. I t was a l ight

gray rock near the top of a mounta i n . Th e wh ole th ing was about th e size of
two tatami mats, the surface smooth and damp. I t was c l oudy and looked
l ike it was about to storm, but there wasn 't any wind. I t seemed near twi l ight,
and b i rds were h u rrying off to their nests. So there the two of us were, under
that cloudy sky, silently having intercourse . We hadn't been married long
at th is time, and the war had separated us. My body was burning for my
h usba n d .
I felt a n indescribable pleasure . We tried all sorts of positions and did it
over and over, c l i maxing again and aga i n . It's strange, n ow that I th ink of i t,
for in real l i fe the two of us were qu iet, rath er introverted peopl e . We 'd never
given i n to our passions l ike this or experienced such soaring pleasu re . But
i n the dream, for th e first time in our l ives, we 'd thrown away all restra i n ts
and were goi ng at it l ike ani mals.
Wh en I opened my eyes it was still dim outside and I felt very odd. My
body fel t heavy, and I could stil l feel my h usband deep i nside me. My heart
was pounding and I found it hard to breath e . My vagina was wet, j ust l ike
after i ntercourse . I t felt as if I 'd really made love and not j ust dreamed it.
I ' m embarrassed to say it, but I masturbated at th is point. I was burning
with l ust and had to do someth ing to calm down .
Afterward I rode my b ike to school as usual and escorted th e c h i ldren
on our field trip to Owan yama. As we walked up the mountain path I could
stil l feel the l i ngering effects of sex. All I had to do was close my eyes and I
could feel my husband coming inside me, his se men shooti ng agai nst the
wall of my womb. I 'd clung to him for all I was worth, my legs spread as
wide as possible, my ankles entangled with h is th ighs. I was, frankly, in a
daze as I took the ch i ldren up the h i l l . I felt l ike I was sti l l in the middle of
that real isti c, erotic drea m .
We c l i mbed up the mountain, reached the spot we were a i m i n g at, and
j ust as the c h i ldren were getti ng ready to fan out to hunt for mushrooms, my
period suddenly starte d . It wasn 't time for it. My last one had stopped only
ten days before, and my periods were always regular. Perhaps th is erotic
dream had stirred something up inside me and set it off. Naturally I hadn't
come prepared, and here we were in the h i lls far from town.
I i nstructed the c h i ldren to take a short break, then I went off alone
fa r into th e woods and took care of mysel f as best I could with a couple of
towels I 'd brought along. Th ere was a great deal of blood, and it made quite
a mess, but I was sure I 'd be able to ma nage until we made i t back to school .
My head was a complete blank, and I couldn't focus at a l l . I had a gu ilty
conscience, I imagine - about that uninhibited dream, about masturbating,

and about having sexual fa ntasies in front of the c h i ldre n . I was usually the
type who suppressed those kinds of thoughts .
I had the c h i l dren go off to gather their mushrooms, a n d was th inking
we'd better make it a short trip and go back as soon as we c o u l d . Back at
school I 'd be able to clean up better. I sat down and watched the c h i ldren
as they hunted for mushrooms. I kept a head count, and made s u re none of
th e m were out of my sight.
After a wh i l e , though , I noticed one l i ttle boy walking toward me
with someth i n g i n h is hands. It was the boy named Nakata�th e same boy
who didn't rega i n consciousness and was hospitalized. He was holding the
bloody towels I 'd used. I gasped and couldn't beli eve my eye s . I 'd h idden
the m far away, out of sight, where the children wouldn't go . You have to
understand that this is the most embarrassing th ing for a wom a n , someth in g
y o u don't w a n t a nybody e l s e t o see. How he w a s able t o unearth th e m I h ave
no idea.
Before I real ized what I was doing, I was slapping him. I grabbed h i m by
the shoulders and was slapping h i m hard on the cheeks . I m i ght have been
yel l i n g someth i ng, I don't recal l . I was out of contro l , no longer i n my right
mind. I th ink the embarrassment must have been so great I was i n shock.
I 'd never,

ever

struck one of the chi ldren before. But it was n ' t m e who was

doing it.
S u ddenly I noticed all the c h i l dren th ere, staring at me. Some were
standing, some s i tting, all of them facing m e . It was all right i n front of
th em�m e , pal e , standing th ere, Nakata collapsed on the gro u n d fro m all
the blows , the bl oody towel s . I t was a moment frozen in ti m e . Nobody
m oved , nobody said a word . The c h i ldren were express ionless, their faces
l ike bronze masks. A deep silence descended on the woods . All you could
hear were the b i rds c h i rping. I can't get that scene out of my m i n d .
I don't know h ow m u c h t i m e passed . Probably n o t so long, but it seemed l ike
forever�time driving m e to the very edge of th e worl d . F i nally I snapped
out of it. Color had retu rned to the world around m e . I hid the bloody towel s
b e h i n d m e and l ifted Nakata up from where he lay. I held h i m tight and
apologized to him as best I could. I was wrong, please , please forgive m e , I
begged h i m . He looked l ike he was sti l l in shock. His eyes were blank, and
I don't th ink he could hear what I said. With h i m sti l l i n my arms I turned to
the other c h i ldren and told th em to resume th eir mushroom h u nting. They
probably couldn't comprehend what had j ust taken place. I t was all too
strange, too sud d e n .

93

I stood there for a wh ile, holding Nakata tight in my arms, fee l i n g l ike I
wanted to die or disappear. Just over the horizon the violence of war went
on, with countl ess people dying. I no l onger had any idea what was right and
what was wrong. Was I really seeing the real world? Was the sound of b i rds I
was hearing real? I found myself alone in the woods, totally confused, blood
flowing freely from my womb. I was angry, afra id, embarrassed - al l of these
rolled into o n e . I cried quietly, without making a sound .
And that's when the chi ldren collapsed .
I wasn 't about t o tel l the mi litary people what h a d really happe n e d . I t
was wartime, and w e h a d t o keep up appearances. S o I left o u t t h e part
about my period starting, about Nakata finding the bloody towels, and me
h i tting h i m . Aga in, I'm afra id th is threw an obstacle i n your path as you
investigated the incident. You can't imagine how rel i eved I a m to finally
get i t off my ch est.
Strangely enough, none of the children had any memory of the i ncident.
Nobody remembered the bl oody towels or me beating Nakata . Those mem­
ories had fallen away completely from their minds. Later, soon after the
incident, I was able to i ndi rectly sound out each c h i l d and confirm that th is
was indeed the case . Pe rhaps the mass coma had already started by the n .
I 'd l ike t o say a few th ings about young Nakata, a s h is former homeroom
teacher. What happened to h i m after the incide nt, I don't really know.
Whe n I was inte rviewed after the war th e American officer told m e h e 'd
been taken to a hospital in Tokyo and finally rega i ned consci ousn ess. But
he wouldn't tel l m e any details. I imagine that you know more about th is
than I do, Professor.
Nakata was one of the five chi ldren evacuated to our town fro m Tokyo,
and of the five he was the brightest and had the best grades. He had very
pl easant features and always dressed wel l . He was a gentle boy and n ever
butted in where he didn't belong. Never once during c lass did h e volunteer
a n answer, but wh en I called on h i m, he always gave th e correct a nswer, and
when I asked h is opinion he'd give a logical reply. H e caught o n right away,
no matter what the sub ject. Every class has a student l ike that, one who'll
study what he needs to without supervision, who you know will one day
attend a top coll ege and get an excellent job. A c h i l d who's innately capabl e .
But a s h is teacher I will say th ere were a couple o f th ings about h i m th at
bothered me. Every so often I felt a sense of resignation in h i m . Even when
he did well on difficult assignments, he never seemed happy. H e n ever
struggled to succeed, never seemed to experi ence the pain of trial and error.

94

He n ever sighed or cracked a smile. It was as if these were th i ngs he had to
get th rough, so he j ust did th e m . He handled whatever came h i s way effi­
ciently - l ike a factory worker,sc rewdriver in hand,working on a c onveyor
belt,tightening a sc rew on each part that comes down the l i n e .
I 've n ever met h i s parents so I c a n ' t say anyth ing for certa in,but th ere
had to be a problem back home. I 'd seen a number of cases l ike th i s . Adu l ts
constantly ra ise the bar on smart c h i l dren,precisely because they're able
to handle it. The c h i l dren get ove rwh elmed by th e tasks i n front of th e m
and gradually lose t h e sort of openness and sens e of accompl ishment they
i n nately have . Wh e n they're treated l ike that,c h i ldren start to c rawl i ns i d e a
shell and keep everyth ing inside. It takes a lot of ti me and effort to get th e m
t o o p e n up aga i n . K i d s ' hearts a r e mall eable,but once th ey g e l i t's h a r d to
get the m back the way they were . Next to i mpossible, in most cases. B u t
maybe I s h o u l d n ' t be giving my opinions on t h e matter - th is i s ,a ft e r a l l ,
your a rea of expertis e .
I also s e n s e d a h i n t of violence i n t h e boy's background. S o m etimes
there 'd be a flash of fear in h i s eyes that seemed an instinctive reaction to
long-term exposur e to violence. What level of violence th is was, I had no way
of knowing. N akata \vas a very self-discipl ined child and good at h i ding h i s
fear. But there'd be t h e occasional involuntary fl i nch,ever so s l i gh t,th at he
couldn't cover up. I knew that someth ing violent had taken place i n his home.
After you spend a lot of time with c h i l dren,you pick up on these th i ngs .
Rural fam i l i e s can be pretty violent. Most of the parents are fa rmers,all
of them struggl ing to make ends meet. They're exhausted,doing ba ckbreak­
ing work fro m morning to night,and when they have a bit to drink and get
angry,they're l i able to strike out phys i cal ly. I t's no secret th is kind of th i n g
goes o n ,and m o s t of t h e t i m e t h e farm k i d s take it i n stride and s u rvive with
no emotional scars. But Nakata's father was a university professor,and h i s
mother,from what I c o u l d gath er from t h e letters she s e n t me,w a s a well­
educated wom a n . An upper-middle-class urban fa mily, i n other words. If
there was any violence taking place i n a family like th at, i t was bound to be
someth i n g more compl i cated and less direct than what farm kids experi­
ence. The kind of violence a child keeps wrapped up inside h i mself.
That's why I especially regretted hitting h i m on the mountain that day,
whether I did it unconsciously or not. I should never have acted that way,
and I 've fel t guilty and ashamed ever since. I regret it even more s i n c e
Nakata - after b e i n g dragged away from h i s parents and p l a c e d i n a n unfa­
miliar environment - was finally on the verge of opening up to m e before
the incident.

95

The kind of violence I displayed th en may very well have dealt a fatal
blow to whatever feelings had been budding i nside h im. I was hoping for an
opportunity to repa i r the harm I 'd caused,but circumstances di ctated other­
wise . Still u nconscious,Nakata was taken to the hosp ital in Tokyo,and I
never saw h im aga i n . It's someth ing I regret to th is day. I can sti l l see the
look o n h is face as I was beating h i m . The tremendous fear and resignation
he fel t at that i nstant.
I 'm sorry,I didn't plan to write such a long letter,but there is one more
th ing I have to menti o n . To tell the truth,when my h usband died i n the
Ph i l i pp i nes j ust before the end of the war, it wasn 't that muc h of a shock.
I didn't feel any despa i r or anger - j ust a deep sense of helpl essness. I didn't
c ry at a l l . I already knew that somewh ere,on some distant battlefield,my
husband would l ose h is l i fe . Ever since the year before,when all those
th ings I j ust wrote about took place - that erotic dream,my period starting
ahead of time,h i tting Nakata,the chi ldren fal l i n g i nto that mysterious
coma - I 'd accepted my husband's death as inevitable,as someth ing fated
to be. So n ews of h is death merely confirmed what I already knew. The
whole experience on the h i l l was beyond anyth ing I 've ever experienced .
I feel l ike I left a part of my soul in those woods.
In closing, I 'd l ike to express my hope that your research will continue to
flourish . Please take good care of yourself.
S i ncerely yours,

Chapter 13

I

t's after twelve, and I ' m eating lunch and gaz ing at the garden when
Osh i m a c o m es over and sits down next to me. Today I 've pretty much got
the l ibra ry to mysel f. As always my lunch is the cheapest box l u n c h from

the l ittl e shop at the tra i n station. We talk for a wh i le,and Osh i m a u rges half
h is sandwiches o n me.
" I made extra today, j ust for you," he insists. " Don't take i t the wrong way,
but you l ook l ike you 're not eating."
'Tm trying to make my stomach shri nk," I explain.
"On pu rpose ?" he asks.
I nod.
"You 're doing that to save money?"
Aga i n I nod.
" I can understa nd that,but at your age you need to eat,and fill up when­
ever you get the chance. You need your nutrition."
The sandwich h e 's offering me looks delici ous. I thank him and start eat­
ing. S m oked sal m o n , waterc ress,and lettuce on soft wh ite bread. Th e c ru st is
nicely crunchy, and horseradish and butter compl ete th e sandwich.
"Did you make th is your self? " I ask.
"No o n e 's about to make it for me," he says.
He pours black coffee from h is th ermos i nto a mug, wh i l e I drink milk
from a l i ttle carton.
"What are you reading these days?"
"Natsume S osek i 's compl ete \vorks," I say. "I sti l l have n ' t read some of his
novels, so th is is a great chance to read th em aIL"
"You l ike h i m enough to want to read eve ryth ing he wrote ? " Osh ima asks.
I n od.
Steam 's rising fro m the cup in h is hand. It's dark and cloudy outside,but
at least the ra i n 's stopped.
"Wh ich of h is n ovels have you read since you came here?"

97

"I fi n ished The Miner, and now I'm on Poppies."

"The Miner, huh?" Osh ima says, apparently searc h i n g out a vagu e mem­
ory of th e book. "That's the story of a college student fro m Tokyo who winds
up working i n a m i n e , right? And he goes through all these tough times with
the other miners and finally returns to the world outside? A sort of medium­
length nove l , as I recal l . I read it a long time ago. The plot isn 't what you nor­
mally expect from Sosek i , and the styl e 's kind of unpolish e d , too . Not one of
h i s best. What do you l ike about it?"
I try putting into words my i mpressions of the nove l , but I need C row's
help - need h i m to show up from wherever he is, spread his wings wide, and
search out the right words for m e .
"Th e m a i n character's from a r i c h family," I say, "but he has an affa i r that
goes sou r and he gets depressed and runs away from h o m e . Wh i l e h e 's sort of
wandering around, th is shady character comes up to h i m and asks him to
work in a mine, and he j ust tags along after h i m and fi nds h i msel f working i n
the Ash i o M i n e . H e 's way down underground, going through all kinds o f
experien ces he never could have imagined. Th is i n nocent r i c h b o y finds
h i mself crawl ing around in the dregs of society."
I sip my milk and try to piece togeth er the rest of what I want to say.
I t takes a wh ile before C row comes back, but Osh i m a waits patie ntly.
"Those are l i fe-and-death-type experien ces he goes through i n the m i n es.
Eventually he gets out and goes back to his old l i fe . B u t noth i n g i n the novel
sh ows he learned anyth ing from these experiences, that his l i fe changed , that
he thought deeply now about the meaning of l i fe or started qu estioning soci­
ety or anyth i ng. You don't get any sense , either, that h e 's matured. You h ave a
strange feeling after you finish the book. It's l ike you wonder what S oseki was
trying to say. It's l ike not really knowing what he's getting at is the part that
stays with you . I can't explain it very wel l ."
"So The Miner's structured very differently fro m , say, S osek i 's Sanshiro,
you r typical modern bildungsroman?"
I nod. "I don't know about that, but you might be right. Sansh i ro grows
up in the story. Runs i nto obstacles, ponders th ings, overcomes diffic u lties,
right? But the hero of The Miner's different. All he does is watch th ings hap­
pen and accept it a l l . I mean , occasionally he gives h is own opini ons, but
noth i n g very deep. I nstead, he j ust broods over h is l ove affa ir. H e comes out
of the mine about the sa me as when he went i n . H e has no sense that it was
someth i n g he decided to do h i mself, or that he had a choice. H e 's l ike totally
passive . But I th ink i n real life people are l ike that. I t's not so easy to make
choices on your own ."

"Do you see yourself as sort of l ike the hero of The Miner?"
I shake my head. "No, I n ever thought of it that way."
"But people need to c l i n g to someth i ng," Osh ima says. "Th ey have to .
You 're doing the same,even though you don't realize it. I t's l ike Goethe sai d:
Everyth i ng's a metaphor."
I mull th is over for a wh i l e .
Osh ima takes a sip of coffee. "At a n y rate, that's a n i n te resting take o n

The Miner. Especially s i n c e you 're both runaways. Makes m e w a n t t o read
it aga i n . "
I fi nish t h e sa ndwich,c rush th e n ow empty milk carton,and toss it i n the
waste can. "Osh i ma," I say, deciding to come right out with i t, ' ' I ' m sort of in
a fix and you 're the only one I can ask for advi ce."
H e opens both hands wide with a go-right-ahead gestur e .
"It's a l o n g story, b u t I don't have anywh ere t o stay tonight. I 've got a
sl eeping bag, so I don't need a futon or bed or anyth ing. Just a roof over my
head. Do you know of any place around here l ike that?"
'Tm guessing that you 're not th inking of a hotel or i n n ? "
I shook my h e a d . "Money's a factor. But I ' m also h o p i n g not to be too
consp i c u ous."
''To the j uven i l e section of the pol ice,I bet."
"Yeah ."
Osh ima th i nks i t over for a time and says,"Well,you could stay here."
"In the library? "
"Sure. I t h a s a roof,a n d a vacant room,too,that n obody uses at night."
"But do you th ink i t's all right? "
"Of course we'll have to make some a rrangements fi rst. B u t it is possib l e .
Or not i mpossible,I should say. I ' m sure I can manage it."
"How so? "
"You l ike t o read good books,t o figure th ings o u t on your own . You look
l ike you 're i n good shape physically, and you're a n independent kind of guy.
You l ike to lead a well-regulated l i fe and have a lot of willpower. I mean, even
the willpower to make your stomach smaller, right? I ' l l talk with Miss Saeki
about you becoming my assistant and staying i n the e mpty room h e re at the
l ibra ry."
"You want m e to be your assistant?"
"You won't have to do much," Osh ima says. "Basi cally help m e open and
c lose the place. We h i re professionals to do the heavy cleaning or to input
th i ngs on the computer. Apart from this, there 's not a whole lot to d o . You can
j ust read whatever you l ike . Sound good ? "

99

"Yeah, of course it does . . . . " I ' m not sure what to say. "But I don't th ink
Miss Saeki 's going to go for it. I ' m only fifteen, and a run away she doesn 't
know a nyth ing about."
"But Miss Saeki's . . . how should I put it?" Osh i m a begins,the n uncharacte risti cally comes to a halt,searching for the right word . "A l i ttle different."
"Different?"
"She has a different take on thi ngs than other people."
I nod. A different take on th ings? What does that mean? "You mean she's
an u nusual perso n ? "
Osh i m a shakes h is head. "No, I wouldn't say that. I f you 're t a l k i n g about
u nusual, that would be me. She j ust isn 't bound by conventional ways of
doing th ings."
I'm stil l trying to figure out the difference betwee n different and unusual,
but decide to hold off on any more questions. For th e time being.
After a pause Osh ima says, "Staying here tonight, though, is a proble m .
S o I ' l l take you someplace else,where you c a n stay for a couple o f days till we
get th i ngs settled. You don't mi nd,do you ? It's a l i ttle far away."
"No problem," I tel l h i m .
"The l ibrary closes at five," Oshima says,"and I have t o stra ighten th i n gs
up, so we'll leave around five-th irty. I ' l l drive you there in my car. N ohody's
staying there now. And not to worry-the place has a roof."
"I appreciate it."
"You can thank me after we get there . It might not be what you're i mag­
mmg."

I go hack to th e readi ng room and pick up where I left off i n Poppies. I'm not
a fast reader. I l ike to l i nger over each sentence, e n j oying the styl e . I f I don't
e n j oy the writi ng, I stop. Just before five I finish th e novel, put it back on the
sh elf, then sit back down on the sofa, close my eyes, and th ink about what
happened l ast night. About Sakura . About her roo m . What she did to m e . All
the twists and turns as events take th eir course .
At five-th i rty I ' m sta nding outside th e l ibrary waiting for Osh i m a . H e
leads m e t o t h e parking l o t o u t around back and w e get i nto h i s gree n sports
car. A Mazda Miata with the top down . My backpack's too big for the l i ttle
trunk, so we tie it down tight on the rear rack.
"It's a long drive, so we'll stop along the way for dinne r," Osh i m a says.
He turns th e ignition key and starts up the engi n e .
"Where a r e we headed?"

100

" Kochi," he repl ies. " Ever been th ere ? "
I shake my head. " H ow far is it?"
"It'll take us about two and a half hours to get where we 're going. Toward
the south,over the mountains."
"You don't mind going so far?"
" I t's okay. I t's a stra ight shot, and it's stil l l ight out. And I 've got a
ful l tank."
We drive through the twi l i t city streets,then get on th e h i ghway heading
west. Osh i m a changes lanes smoothly,sl ipping i n betwee n oth er ca rs, effort­
lessly sh i fting gears. Each time the hum of the engine changes sl ightly. Wh en
he sh ifts gears and floors it,th e l i ttle car's soon zipping along at over n i nety.
"The car's specially tu ned,so it's got a lot of pickup. This isn 't your ordi­
nary Miata . D o you know much about cars?"
I shake my head. Cars a re definitely not my specialty. " D o you e n j oy
driving?" I ask.
"The doctor made me give up any risky sports. So i nstead I drive . Com­
pensatio n . "
"Is someth ing wrong with you ? "
"The m e d i c a l name's k i n d of long,b u t it's a type of hemoph i l ia," Osh i m a
says casual ly. " D o y o u know what that is?"
" I th ink so," I say. I learned about it i n biology class. "Once you start
bleeding you can't stop. It's genetic, where the blood doesn 't coagulate . "
"That's right. There 're all kinds of hemoph i l ia, and t h e type I h a v e i s
pretty rare . It's not s u c h a b a d ty p e of th e disease,but I have t o be carefu l n o t
t o g e t i n j ur e d . Once I start bleeding I have t o g o t o th e hospita l . Besides,
these days there 're problems with the blood supply in hospitals. Dyi n g a slow
death fro m AI D S isn't a n option for me. So I 've made som e connections in
town to supply m e with safe blood, j ust in case . Because of my disease I don't
go on trips. Except for regular checkups at the university hospital i n
H i rosh ima, I hardly ever leave town . It's n o t s o bad,th ough - I never d i d l ike
traveling or sports all that much anyway. I can't use a kitchen knife,so doing
any real cooking's out,wh ich is kind of a shame."
" Drivi ng's a risky enough sport," I tell h i m .
" I t's a different k i n d of risk. Wh enever I drive I try t o g o as fast as I c a n . I f
I ' m i n a n accident driving fast I won 't j ust w i n d up getti ng a cut fi nger. I f you
lose a lot of blood,th ere's no difference between a hemoph i l iac and a nybody
else . It evens th i ngs out, since your chances of survival are the sam e . YOH
don't have to worry about th i ngs l ike blood coagulation or a nyth i n g, and can
die without any regrets,"

101

"1 see."

"Don't worry," Osh ima la ughs. "I'm not going have a n accident. I'm a
careful driver and don't push it. 1 keep my car in top condition, too . B esides,
when I die I want to die quietly, all by mysel f."
"Taking someone else with you, then, isn 't a n option either."
"You got it."

We pull into a rest stop restaurant for dinner. 1 have c h i cken and a salad, he
orders the seafood cu rry and a salad. Just someth ing to fi l l our stomachs, is the
best you could say about it. Osh ima pays the bill, and we c l i m b i n to the car
aga i n . It's al ready gotten dark. H e steps on the accelerator and the tachome­
ter shoots way up.
"Do you m i n d if I put on some music?" Osh ima asks.
"Of course n ot," 1 reply.
H e pushes the C D 's play button and some c lassical piano music sta rts.
I l isten for a while, figuring out the musi c . I know it's not B eethoven, and not
S c h u m a n n . Probably somebody who came in betwe e n .
" S chubert?" 1 ask.
"Good guess," he repl ies. H is hands at ten-an d-two on the steering wheel,
he glances over at m e . " Do you l ike Sch ubert? "
"Not parti cularly," I tell h i m .
"When 1 drive I l ike t o l isten t o Schubert's p i a n o sonatas with t h e vol u m e
tu rned up. Do y o u know why?"
"1 have no idea."

"Because playing Schubert's piano sonatas well is one of the hardest
th ings i n the worl d . Especially this, the Sonata i n 0 Ma j or. I t's a tough p i e c e
t o maste r. Some pianists can play one or maybe two of t h e m ovem ents per­
fectly, but if you l isten to all four movements as a unified whole, no one has
ever nailed it. A lot of famous pianists have tri ed to rise to the challenge, but
it's l ike there's always someth ing missi ng. Th ere's n ever one where you can
say, Yes! He's got it! Do you know why? "
" N o," I reply.
" B ecause the sonata itself is imperfect. Robert Schumann understood
Schubert's sonatas well, and he labeled th is one ' H eavenly Tedious.' ''
"If the composition's imperfect, why would so many pianists try to
m aster it?"
"Good question," Osh ima says, and pauses as music fills i n the silence . " I
have no great explanation for it, but one th ing 1 can say. Works that have a

102

certa i n imperfection to th e m have an appeal for that very reason - or at l east
they appeal to certa in types of peopl e . Just l ike you 're attracted to Soseki's

The Miner. Th ere's someth ing in it that draws you i n , more than more fully
realized n ovels l ike Kokoro or Sanshiro. You discover someth i n g about that
work that tugs at your heart - or maybe we should say the work discovers you.
Schubert's Sonata in 0 Ma jor is sort of the same th ing."
"To get back to the questi on," I say, "why do you l isten to Schubert's
sonatas? Especially when you 're driving?"
"If you play Schubert's sonatas, especially th is one stra ight through , i t's
not art. Like S c h u m a n n pointed out, it's too long and too pastoral , and tech­
nically too simpl istic. Play it through the way it is and it's flat and tastel ess,
some dusty antique. Wh ich is why every pianist who atte mpts it adds some­
th ing of h i s own , someth ing extra . Like th is - hear how he a rtic u lates it th ere?
Adding rubato . Ad j usti ng the pac e , modulati o n , whatever. Oth erwise they
can't hold it all together. They have to be carefu l , though , o r else all those
extra devices destroy the dignity of the piece. Th en it's not Schubert's music
a nymore . Every single pianist wh o 's pl ayed this sonata struggl es with the
sa me paradox."
H e l istens to the music , humming the melody, then conti nues.
"That's why I l ike to l isten to Schubert wh i l e I'm driving. Like I sa i d , it's
because a l l the performan ces are imperfect. A dense, artistic k i n d of i mper­
fection stimulates your consciousness, keeps you alert. If I l isten to some
utterly pe rfect performance of an utterly pe rfect piece wh i l e I'm driving, I
might want to c l ose my eyes and die right th en and th ere. B u t l iste n i n g to the
o m a j or, I can feel the l i mits of what h umans are capable of- that a certa i n

type of perfection c a n only be real ized through a l i mitless a c c umulation o f
the imperfect. A n d personally, I find that encouraging. Do y o u know what
I'm getti ng at?"
" Sort of. . . . "
'Tm sorry," Osh ima says. " I tend to get carried away on the sub j ect."
"But there's a l l kinds and degrees of i mperfecti o n , right? " I say.
" S ure, of c o urse ."

"Comparatively speaking, wh ich performance of the 0 major sonata do
you th i nk's the best? "
"That's a tough one." Osh ima gives it some thought. H e sh i fts down ,
swings over to the passing lane, swi ftly slips pass a huge refrigerated eighteen­
wheeler, sh i fts u p , and steers back into our lane. "Not to frighten you , but a
green Miata is one of th e hardest veh i cles to spot on the h ighway at night. I t
h a s s u c h a l o w profi l e , p l u s t h e green te nds t o b l e n d i nto t h e darkness. Tru c k

drivers especially can't see it from up in th eir cabs. It can be a risky business,
particularly in tu nnels. Sports cars really should be red . The n they'd stand
out. That's why m ost Ferraris are red . But I happen to l ike green, even i f i t
makes th ings m o r e dangerous. Green's t h e c o l o r of a forest. Red's t h e c o l o r
of blood ."
H e glances at his watch and goes back to humming along with the
musi c . "Generally I 'd have to say Brendel and Ashkenazy give the best per­
formances, though they don't do anyth ing for me emotional ly. Schubert's
music challenges and shatters the ways of the worl d . That's the essence of
Romanticism,and Schubert's music is the epitome of the Romanti c . "
I keep on l istening t o the sonata.
"What do you th ink? Kind of boring?" he asks.
"Ki nd of," I admit.
"You can appreciate Sch ubert if you tra i n yoursel f. I was the sam e way
when I fi rst l istened to him -it bored me sil ly. I t's only natural for someone
your age. I n time you'll appreciate it. People soon get tired of th ings that
aren't bori ng, but not of what is boring. Go figure . For me, I might h ave the
leisure to be bored,but not to grow tired of someth i n g . Most people can't dis­
tingu ish between th e two ."
"You sa id you 're an unusual person. Do you mean because of the
h emoph i l i a ? "
"That's part of i t," he says, and gives this devil ish sort of smi l e . "There's
more to it than that."

Schubert's long "Heavenly" sonata fi nish es, and we don't l isten to any more
musi c . We fal l sile nt, each of LIS filling in the silence with our own random
thoughts. I gaze vacantly at the passing signs. At a j unction we turn south and
th e road heads into th e mountai ns, one long tu nnel after another. Osh i m a
concentrates hard each time he passes another veh i c l e . We g o b y a number o f
slow-moving trucks on the road,a n d every time there's th is whooshing moan
of a i r, l ike somebody's soul is being yanked out. Occasionally I look back to
make sure my backpack's stil l tied down okay.
"The place we 're headed is deep in the mountai ns, not the m ost pl easant
dwe l l i n g i n th e world," Oshima says. "I doubt you 'll see anybody else wh i l e
you 're the re . Th ere's no radio,TV , or phon e . Sur e y o u don't m i n d ? "
"I don't," I reply.
"You 're used to being alone," Osh ima comments .

I nod.
"But sol itude comes in different varieties. What's waiting for you might
be a l i ttle unexpected."
"How so? "
Osh ima pushes up the bridge o f h is glasses. " I can't really say. I t might
change , depending o n you."
We get off the h ighway and start down a small regional roadway. Al ong a
side road near the exit there's a small town . Osh ima stops at a convenience
store and buys a l m ost more groceries than we can carry - vegetables and
fru it, crackers, milk and mineral water, canned goods, bread , pouch-packed
i nstant food, mostly th i ngs that don't requ ire much cooking. I start to take out
my wal l et, but h e shakes his head and pays for it a l l .
B a c k i n t h e sports c a r , w e head down t h e roa d . I ' m holding t h e bags that
wouldn't fit i n to the tru nk. Once we leave the l i ttle town everyth i n g is dark
around us. N o houses, and only the occasional car, the road so n arrow i t's
hard for two cars to pass each oth er. Osh i m a fl i ps on the h igh beams and
races ahead, braking, accel erating, sh ifting from second to th ird and back.
H is expression is fixed as he focuses on driving, l i ps tight, eyes riveted on a
point up ahead i n the darkn ess, right hand clutch ing the top of the whe e l , left
hand poised for action on the gearsh ift knob.
A sharp b l u ff appears on our left side . It looks l ike th ere's a mountain
strea m down below. The curves get sharper, the road more slippery, and a
couple of times the rear end of the car spi ns, but I decide not to worry about
it. As far as Osh i m a is concerned, having an accident here m ost l ikely isn't an

option.
My watch sh ows a l ittl e before n i n e . I crack open my window and let th e
cold a i r rush i n . Everyth ing sounds different here . We 're i n the mountains,
heading i n deeper. I breathe a sigh of rel ief when the road fi n ally c u ts away
from the bluffs and turns into a forest. Trees magically soar above us. O ur
headligh ts l ick at th e tru nks, illumi nating one after another. We 've left the
paved road beh i n d , the ti res squ irting out pebbles that ricochet agai nst the
bottom of the car. The suspension dances up and down over the rough road .
Th ere's no moon out, no stars. A fine ra in occasi onally splashes aga i nst the
wi ndsh i e l d .
" D o y o u c ome here a l o t ? " I ask.
"I used to . Now, with the job and all I can't come so often . My older
brother's a surfe r and l ives on the shore in Koc h i . H e runs a surf shop th e re
and makes surfboards. He comes here sometimes. Do you surf? "

105

" N ever tried it," I tell h i m.
" I f you have the chance, you should have my brother teach you. H e 's
very good," Osh ima says. "If you meet h i m you ' l l see h e 's not at a l l l ike me.
H e 's big, tan, kind of qui et, not so sociable, and l ikes beer. And wouldn't
know Schubert fro m Wagner. But we get along really well."
We continue down the road through th ick woods, and finally turn off.
Osh ima stops th e car and, leaving the engine running, c l i mbs out and
u n locks a kind of wire fe nce and pushes it open. We drive i nside and proceed
down another windy, bu mpy road into a clearing where the road e nds.
Osh ima stops the car, sighs heavi ly, and brushes his h a i r back with both
hands, the n kills the engine and sets the parking brake.
The fan stil l h u ms, cooling off the overheated engine as steam rises fro m
t h e h o o d , b u t with t h e engine off a heavy sti l l ness falls over us. I h e a r a small
strea m nearby, th e faint sound of water. H i gh above us th e wind rustles sym­
bolically. I open the door and step outside. Patches of c h i l l hang in the a i r. I
have on a yacht j acket over my T-sh irt and zip it up to my neck.
Th ere's a small b u i lding in front of us, a log cabin by the look of it,
th ough i t's too dark to see much. Just a dark outl i n e floating agai nst the back­
ground of the forest. The headlights stil l on, Osh ima slowly approac h es the
cab i n , flash l ight in hand, walks up the porch steps, takes out a key, a n d
unlocks t h e door. H e goes inside, strikes a matc h , and l i ghts a lamp. H e the n
steps o u t onto t h e porc h , holding the lamp, a n d announces, "Welcome t o m y
house." It all looks l ike a drawing in an o l d storybook.
I walk up the steps and go i nside. Osh i ma l i ghts a larger l amp suspended
fro m the c e i l i ng. The cabin consists of a single big, boxy room. Th ere's a
small bed i n the corner, a dining table and two woode n chairs, an old sofa , a
hopel essly faded rug-a bunch of old fu rniture nobody wanted, it l ooks l i k e ,
j ust thrown togeth er. There's a c i n d e r block and board s h e l f cra m m e d ful l of
books, th eir covers worn l ike they've been read a lot. There's also an old ch est
for storing c loth es. And a simple kitchen with a counter, a small gas stove ,
and a sink but no running water. Instead, an aluminum pail I guess is for
water. A pan and kettle on a shelf, plus a frying pan hanging from the wall.
And i n the middle of the room th ere's a black wood-burning stove.
" My brother built this cabin al most all by h i mself. He took th e original
rough l u mberjack hut and remodeled it completely. H e 's good with h is
hands. I was stil l pretty l i ttle then and helped out a bit, making sure I didn't
get cut or anyth ing. It's pretty primitive. No electricity. No ru nning water. N o
toilet. T h e o n l y modern convenience is t h e propane gas." Osh i m a pours
some mineral water into the kettl e and sets it to boil.

10 6

"My grandfather originally own ed this mounta i n . H e was a pretty
wealthy man i n Koc h i , with a lot of property. H e passed away ten years ago,
and my brother and I i n herited almost the entire mounta i n . N o other rela­
tives wanted it. I t's too far off the beaten track, and not worth muc h . I f you
were goi ng to m a i n t a i n it for harvesting trees, you 'd have to h i re people and
it'd cost too much."
I open th e c ur t a i n at the window. Al l I can see is a wall of total darkness.
"Wh e n I was j ust about your age," Osh ima says, dipping chamomile tea
bags i nto a pot, "I used to come here a lot and l ive on my own . Not see any­
body else , not talk to a nybody. My brother almost forced me to . Usually, with
somebody who has a disease l ike m i n e , you wou ldn't do that - too dangerous
for th e m to be alone i n some isolated spot. But my brothe r didn't m i n d . " He
leans back agai nst the cou nter, waiting for the wate r to boi l . "He wasn 't trying
to discipline m e or anything, it's j ust what he believed I needed. Looking
back on it, I can see it was a good experience, someth ing I did need. I could
read a lot, th ink th ings over. To tell the truth , after a certa i n period I hardly
went to schoo l . School and I had sort of a mutual hate relationsh i p goi ng.
I was different from everybody else . Out of th e kindness of th eir hearts they
let me graduate from j unior h igh , but after that I was on my own , basical ly.
Just l ike you . D i d I al ready tell you all th is? "
I shake my h e a d . "Is that why you 're being so nice to m e ? "
"That's part of i t , " he says, t h e n pauses. " B u t that's n o t t h e w h o l e reaso n . "
Osh ima passes me a c u p of tea and sips at his own . My nerves a re tense
after the long drive, and the chamomile is j ust what I need to c a l m down .
Osh ima gla n c es at h is watc h . ''I 'd better be goi ng, so let me expla i n every­
th ing. Th ere's a nice stream nearby you can use for water. I t's spring fed so
you can drink it as is. Much better than these bottles of m i n e ral wate r.
Th ere's fi rewood stacked up i n back so use the stove i f you get c o l d . It gets
pretty chilly here . I 've even used it a few times in August. You c a n use the
stove for simple cooking. I f you need any other tools or a nyth i n g , check the
toolsh ed out back. And feel free to wear any old c l othes of my brother's you
find in the dresser. H e doesn 't care if somebody wears his th i ngs."
Osh ima rests his hands on h is h ips and gives th e cabin a onc e-over. "It's
not some romantic getaway, that's for sure . But for simple l iving, it'll d o . One
th ing I 've got to warn you about - don't go very far into the woods. The forest
is really dense , and th ere's not a good path th rough it. Always keep the c a b i n
i n sight. I t's easy t o g e t lost if y o u g o a n y farth er, and it's hard t o fi n d y o u r way
back. I had a terrible experi ence there once. I was only a couple h u n d red
yards fro m here but spent half the day goi ng in c i rcles. You might th ink

Japan's a small country, that there's no chance you could get lost in a forest.
B u t once you get l ost in these woods, believe m e , you stay l ost."
I fi l e that away for future reference.
"And except for an emergency, I wouldn't come down off the mounta i n.
I t's too far to any other houses. Just wa it here, and I ' l l be back i n a couple of
days to pick you up. You have enough food to see you through. By the way, do
you have a cell phone?"
" I do," I tel l him, pointing at my backpack.
He grins at me. " Keep it in your pack. It won't work here - yo u 're Ollt of
ran ge. And of course a radio won't work either. You 're cut off from the world.
You should be able to get a lot of readi ng done."
I suddenly th ink of a very practical question. "If there's no toilet, where
should I go to the bathroom?"
Osh ima spreads both hands wide. "The forest is all yours. I t's lip to you."

Chapter 14

N

akata visited the vacant lot for several days. One morning it ra i n e d
heavi ly, s o h e spent t h e d a y d o i n g s i m p l e woodwork i n g i n h is room ,
b u t apart from that he spent h is time seated i n the weeds wa iting

for the missing tortoiseshell cat to sh ow up, or the man i n the stra nge hat. But
no luck.
At the end of each day Nakata stopped by the home of the people who'd
h i red h i m and gave an update on his searc h�wh ere he'd gon e , what sort of
i n formation h e 'd managed to pick up. The cat's own er would pay him twenty
dollars, his goi n g rate . Nobody had ever officially set th at fee , word j ust got
around that there was a master cat-fi nder in the neighborhood and somehow
he settl ed on that d a i ly rate . People would always give h i m someth ing extra
besides the m o n ey, too�food, occasionally cl othes. And a bonus of eighty
dollars once he actually tracked down the missing cat.
Nakata wasn't constantly being asked to search for missing cats, so the
fees he accumulated each month didn't add up to mu c h . Th e older of his
younger broth ers paid his uti l i ties out of the i nheritance Nakata's parents had
left h i m�wh ich wasn 't very much to begin with�and he l ived on h is mea­
ger savings and a municipal monthly subsidy for the elderly handi cappe d . He
managed to get by on the subsidy alone, so he could spend his cat-finding fees
as he wished, and for him i t seemed l ike a substantial amount. S o m etimes,
though , he couldn't come up with any idea of h ow to spen d it, other tha n
e n j oying his favorite grilled eel . G o i n g t o t h e b a n k or h a v i n g a savings
account at th e post offi c e involved fi l l ing out forms, so any l eftove r money h e
h i d ben eath t h e tatami i n h is room .
Being able t o conve rse with cats was Nakata's l i ttle secret. O n l y h e and
the cats knew about it. People would th i nk he was crazy i f he mentioned it, so
he never did. Everybody knew he wasn 't very bright, but being d u m b and
being crazy were different matters altogether.

S o m etimes people would walk by when he was deep i n conversati on
with a cat,but they never seemed to care . It wasn 't so u nusual,after all,to see
old folks talking to animals as if they were people . But i f anyone did happen
to comment on h is abilities with cats and say someth ing l ike, " Mr. Nakata,
how are you able to know cats' habits so wel l ? It's a l m ost l ike you can talk with
th em," h e 'd j ust smile and let it pass. Nakata was always serious and well man­
nered, with a pleasant smile, and was a favorite among the h ousewives in
the neighborhood. H i s neat appearance also helped. Poor though he was,
Nakata e n j oyed bath i n g and doing laundry,and th e nearly brand-new c l othes
his c l i ents often gave him only added to h is clean-c u t look. Some of the
clothes - a sal m o n pink Jack N i cklaus golf sh i rt, for i nstance - didn't exactly
suit h i m,but Nakata didn't mind as long as they were neat and clea n .

Nakata was standing at the front door, giving a halting report t o h i s present
c l i ent,Mrs. Koizumi,on the search for her cat,Coma .
"Nakata finally got some information about l i ttle Coma," he bega n . "A
person named Kawa mura sa id that a few days ago he saw a cat resembling
Coma over i n th e e mpty lot, the one with the wall around i t, over i n the
2-chome D istrict. I t's two big roads away from here,and he sa i d th e age,coat,
and collar are a l l the sam e as Coma's. Nakata decided to keep a lookout at the
empty lot, so I take a lunch and sit there every day, morning till sunset. No,
don't worry about that - I have plenty of free time,so u n less i t's ra i n i n g hard
I don't mind at all . But if you th ink it's no longer necessary,ma'am,for me to
be on the lookout,then please tel l me. I will stop right away."
H e didn't tel l her th at th is Mr. Kawamura wasn 't a person but a striped
brown cat. That,he figured,would only compli cate matters.
Mrs. Koiz umi thanked h i m . Her two l i ttle daughte rs were in a gloomy
mood after th eir beloved pet suddenly va nished, and had l ost their appetite .
Th eir mother couldn't j ust explain it away by tell i n g them that cats tended to
disappea r every once i n a wh i l e . But desp ite th e shock to th e girls,she didn't
h ave the time to go around town looking for their cat. That made h e r a l l the
more glad to fi n d a person l ike Nakata who, for a mere twenty dollars per
diem, would do h is best to search for Coma. Nakata was a strange old man,
and had a weird way of speaki ng, but people claimed he was an absolute
genius when it came to locating cats. She knew sh e shouldn't th ink about it
l ike this, but th e old man didn't seem bright enough to deceive anyo n e . She
handed him h is fee in an envel ope, as well as a Tupperware container with
some vegetable rice and taro potatoes she 'd j ust cooked .

110

Nakata bowed as he took the Tu pperware,sniffed the food, and thanked
her. "Thank you kindly. Taro is one of Nakata's favorites."
"I hope you e n j oy it," Mrs. Koizu mi repl i e d .

A week had passed since he fi rst staked out t h e empty lot, dur i n g which time
Nakata had seen a lot of different cats come in and out. Kawamu ra, the
striped brown cat,stopped by a couple of times each day to say hello. Nakata
greeted h i m,and chatted about the weather and h is sub city. H e stil l couldn't
fol l ow a word the cat sa i d .
"C rouch o n pavement, Kawara 's in trouble," Kawamura sa i d . H e seemed
to want to convey something to Nakata, but the old man d i d n 't have a c l u e
and he sa i d s o .
T h e cat seemed perplexed b y th is, and repeated t h e sam e - p o ssib ly the
same - thought in different words. "Kawara 's shouting tied." Nakata was even
more l ost.
Too bad M i m i 's not here to help out, he th ought. M i m i 'd give the cat a
good slap on the cheek and get h i m to make some sense . A smart cat, that
M i m i . But M i m i n ever showed up in a field l ike th is, since she hated getti n g
fl e a s from othe r cats.
Once he'd sp illed out all these ideas Nakata couldn't fol low, Kawamura
left beaming.
Other cats filtered i n and out. At first they were on their guard when they
spotted Nakata,gazing at him from a distance in annoyance,but after they saw
that he was simply sitti ng there, doing noth i ng, they forgot all about h i m . I n
h is typical friendly way,Nakata tried t o strike up conversations. H e 'd say hello
and introduce h i mself,but most of the cats turned a deaf ear,pretending th ey
couldn't hear h i m,or stare right through h i m . Th e cats here were parti cularly
adept at giving someone the cold shoulder. They must have had some pretty
awful experi ences with humans, Nakata decided. He was in no position to
demand anyth ing of them, and didn't blame them fo r their coldness. He knew
very well that i n the world of cats he would always be an outsider.
" S o you can talk, huh?" the cat, a black-and-white tabby with torn ears,
sa i d a bit hesitantly as it gl anced arou nd. Th e cat spoke gruffly but seemed
nice e nough .
"Yes,a l i ttle," Nakata repl i e d .
"Impressive a l l t h e sa me," t h e tabby commented .
"My name's Nakata," Nakata sa id, i ntrod ucing h i mself. "And your name
would be?"

111

"Ai n ' t got one," the tabby sa id brusquely.
" H ow about Okawa? Do you mind if I call you that?"
"Whatever."
"We l l , th e n , Mr. Okawa ," Nakata sa id, "as a token of our meeting each
other, would you care for some dried sardines?"
" Sounds good . One of my favorites, sardines."
Nakata took a saran-wrapped sardine from his bag and opened i t up for
Okawa . He always had a few sardines with h i m , j ust in case . Okawa gobbled
down the sardi n e , stripping it from head to ta i l , then cleaned h is fac e .
'That h i t t h e spot. Much obliged. I 'd be happy t o l i ck y o u somewhere,
i f you'd l ike."
" N o , th ere's no need to . Nakata's grateful for the offer, but right n ow I
don't need to be l i cked anywhere, thanks all th e sam e . Actually, I 've been
asked by i ts owner to locate a missing cat. A female tortoisesh ell by the n a m e
of Coma." Nakata took t h e c o l o r snapshot of C o m a out of h is b a g and showed
i t to Okawa . " Someone tol d me this cat has been spotted in th is vacant lot. So
Nakata's been sitti ng here for several days wa iting for Coma to show up. I was
wondering i f, by chance, you may have ru n across her."
Okawa glanced at the ph oto and made a gl oomy fac e . Frown l in es
appeared betwee n h is eyebrows and he bli nked i n conste rnatio n several
times. " I ' m gratefu l for the sardine, don't get me wrong. But I can't talk about
that. I'll be i n hot water i f I do."
Nakata was bewildered. "In hot water if you talk about it?"
"A dangerous, nasty busi ness, it is. I th ink you 'd better write that cat off.
And if you know what's good for you , you'll stay away from th is place . I don't
want you to get i n trouble. Sorry I couldn't be of more help, but j ust consider
th is warning my way of thanking you for the food." With th is Okawa stood up,
l ooked around, and disappeared into a th icket.
Nakata sighed, took out h is thermos, and slowly sipped som e tea . Okawa
had sa i d i t was dangerous to be here, but Nakata couldn't imagine h ow. All
he was doing was looking for a lost l i ttle cat. What could possibly be danger­
ous about that? Maybe it was that cat-catcher with the strange hat Kawamura
told him about who's dangerous. But Nakata was a perso n , not a cat. S o why
should he be afra i d of a cat-catcher?
But the world was full of many th i ngs Nakata couldn't hope to fath o m , so
he gave up th inking about it. With a brain l ike h is, the only resul t h e got fro m
th inking too m u c h was a headache. Nakata sipped t h e l ast drop of h is tea ,
screwed the cap o n the thermos, and placed it back inside h is bag.
After Okawa disappeared into the th icket, no other cats showed u p for a

112

long time. Just butte rfl i es, silently fluttering above the weeds. A flock of spar­
rows flew into the lot, scatte red in various directions, regrouped, and wi nged
away. Nakata dozed off a few times, coming awake with a start. H e knew
approxi mately what time it was by the position of the su n .
It was nearly evening when the dog showed u p i n front of h i m .
A h uge, black d o g suddenly appeared from o u t o f th e th icket, silently
lumbering forward. From where Nakata sat, the beast l ooked more l ike a calf
than a dog. I t had long legs, short h a i r, bulgi ng, steely muscles, ears as sha rp
as knife points, and no collar. Nakata didn't know much about breeds of dogs,
but one glance told h i m this was the vicious variety, or at least one th at could
turn mean i f i t had to . The kind of dog the mil itary used i n i ts K-9 corps.
The dog's eyes were totally expressionless and the ski n around i ts mouth
tu rned up, exposing wicked-looking fangs. I ts teeth had blood stuck to them,
and sl imy bits of meat matted around i ts mouth . I ts bright red tongue fl i cked
out betwee n i ts teeth l ike a fl a m e . The dog fixed its glare on Nakata and stood
there, u nmoving, without a sound, for a long time. Nakata was silent too . He
didn't know h ow to speak to dogs - only cats. The dog's eyes were as glazed
and l i fel ess as glass beads congealed from swa mp water.
Nakata breathed qui etly, shallowly, but he wasn 't afra i d . He had a pretty
good idea he was face-to-face with a hostile, aggressive a n i m a l . (Why th is was,
he had no idea.) But he didn't carry th is th ought one step fu rthe r and see

himself i n i m m i n e n t peri l . The concept of death was beyond his powers of
i maginati o n . And pain was something he wasn 't aware of until h e actually felt
it. As a n abstract concept pain didn't mean a th ing. The upshot of th is was h e
wasn 't afraid, even with this monstrous d o g staring h i m down . H e w a s merely
perplexe d .
Stand up! t h e d o g sa i d .

Nakata g u l p e d . T h e d o g was talking! N o t really talking, s i n c e i ts m outh
wasn 't movi n g - but communicating through some means other tha n
speec h .
Stand u p a n d follow me! t h e d o g commanded .

Nakata did as he was told, clambering to h is feet. He considered sayi ng
hello to the dog, then thought better of it. Even i f they were able to converse,
he didn't th ink i t would be of much use. Besides, he didn't feel l ike talking
with the dog, much l ess givi ng it a name. No amount of time would turn i t
into a fri e n d .
A thought c rossed Nakata 's mi nd: Maybe th is d o g has s o m e connection
with th e Governor, who found out he was getting money for finding cats and
was goi ng to take away h is sub city ! Wouldn't surprise m e at a l l , h e thought, i f

th e Governor had th is K-9 kind of dog. And if that's what's going on, I ' m i n
big troubl e !
O n c e Nakata got t o h i s feet, the dog slowly started t o walk away. Nakata
shouldered his bag and set off after h i m. The dog had a short tail and, below
i ts base, two large balls.
The dog cut stra ight ac ross the vacant lot and slipped out between the
wooden fence. Nakata followed, and the dog never l ooked back. No doubt he
could tel l by the sound of his footsteps that Nakata was behind h i m. As they
drew c l oser to the shopping district the streets grew more crowded, m ostly
with housewives out shoppi ng. Eyes fixed stra ight ah ead, th e dog walked
on, h is whole bearing overpowering. When people sp ied th is giant, violent­
looking beast, they leaped aside, a couple of b i cycl ists even getti ng off a n d
crossing over t o t h e oth er s i d e of the street t o avoid facing h i m.
Walking behind th is monstrous dog made Nakata feel that people were
getting out of his way. Maybe they thought he was walking the dog, m i nus a
leash. And indeed some people shot h i m reproachfu l l ooks. Th is made h i m
sad. I ' m n o t doing this because I want to, he wanted t o expla i n t o them.
Nakata 's being led by th is dog, he wanted to say. Nakata 's not a strong person,
but a weak one.
H e fol l owed the dog qu ite a distance. They passed a number of i n tersec­
tions and e merged fro m the shopp ing district. Th e dog ignored traffi c signals
at crosswalks. The roads weren't so wide, and the cars were n 't going fast, so it
wasn 't all that dangerous to cross on red. The drivers slammed on the i r brakes
wh en they saw th is huge animal i n front of them. For h is part, the dog bared
his fangs, glared at the drivers, and sauntered defiantly ac ross the street. Th e
dog knew ful l well what the traffi c l i ghts meant, Nakata could sense, but was
wil lfully ignoring them. This dog was used to getting his way.
Nakata no l onger knew where they were. At one point they passed a resi­
dential area i n Nakano Ward he was fa miliar with, but the n they tu rned a cor­
ner and he was no longer in fa miliar territory. Nakata fel t anxious. What was
he goi ng to do if he got lost and couldn't find h is way back? For all h e knew
they might not eve n be i n Nakano Ward anymore. H e craned h is neck, trying
to spot fam i l i a r landmarks, but no such l uck. Th is was a part of the c ity h e 'd
never seen before .
Unconcerned, the dog kept walki ng, keep ing a pace he knew Nakata
could keep up with, head up, ears perked, balls swaying l ike a pendulum.
"Say, is th is stil l Nakano Ward? " Nakata called out.
The dog didn't respond or look around.
"Do you work for the Governor? "

Aga i n no response .
"Nakata 's j ust looking for a l ost cat. A small tortoisesh ell cat named
Goma."
Noth ing.
Th is was getti ng him nowhere,and he gave u p .

They c a m e t o a corner in a quiet residential area with big houses but no
passe rsby, and the dog boldly strode through an open old-fash ioned double
gate set into an old-style stone wall surrounding one of the houses. A large car
was parked i n a carport - big and black j ust l ike the dog, and sh i ny. The front
door of the house was open as wel l . Th e dog went right inside,without hesi tat­
ing. Before stepping into the house,Nakata took off h is old sneakers and l ined
th em up neatly at the entrance, stuffed his h iking hat inside h is bag, and
brush ed grass blades off h is trousers. The dog stood there,wa iting for Nakata to
make h i mself presentable, then went down the pol ished wooden corridor,
leading h i m to what looked l ike either a sitti ng room or a l ibrary.
Th e room was dark. Th e sun had almost set and the heavy c u rtain at the
window facing the garden was drawn . No l i ghts were on. Farth e r back i n the
room was a large desk, and it looked l ike someone was sitti n g beside it.
Nakata knew h e 'd h ave to wa it until his eyes adj usted to say for sure . A black
silhouette Aoated th e re indistinctly, l ike a paper cutout. As Nakata entered
the room the silhouette slowly turned. Whoever was there sat i n a swivel c h a i r
and had turned a r o u n d t o face h i m . H is duty d o n e ,t h e d o g c a m e t o a halt,
plopped down on the Aoor,and closed his eyes.
"Hello," N akata sa id to the dark outl in e .
T h e other person didn't say a th ing.
"Sorry to bother you,but my name is Nakata . I ' m not a n i n truder."
No reply.
"Th is dog told m e to fol l ow h i m, so here I a m . Excuse me, but th e dog
j ust went right into your house and I came after h i m . If you don't m i n d
terribly, I ' l l be l eaving . . . . "
"Take a seat on the sofa, if you would," the man sa i d i n a soft but strong
ton e .
"Al l right, I 'll do that," Nakata sa id, lowering h i mse l f o nto t h e o n e­
person sofa . Right next to h i m, the dog was sti ll as a statu e . "Are you . . . the
Governor?"
"Someth i n g l ike that," the man sa id from the darkness. "If that makes it
easier for you,th e n go ahead and th ink that. I t doesn 't m atter."

1 15

Th e man tur n e d around and tugged at a chain to turn on a Aoor lamp.
A yel low, antiqu ish l ight snapped on, faint but sufficient for the room .
The m a n before h i m was tall, th i n , and wearing a black silk hat. H e was
seated o n a leather swivel chair, his legs crossed in front of h i m . He had on a
form-fitting red coat with long tails, a black vest, and long black boots. H i s
trousers were as wh ite as snow a n d fit h i m perfectly. One hand was raised to
the brim of his hat, l ike he was tipp ing it politely to a lady. H is left hand
gripped a black walking stick by the round, gold knob. Looking at the hat,
Nakata suddenly thought: This must be the cat-catcher!
The man's featu res weren't as unusual as h is cl oth es. He was somewhere
between young and old, handsome and ugly. H is eyebrows were sharp and
th ick, and his c heeks had a healthy glow. H is face was terribly smooth , with
no wh iskers at a l l . Below narrowed eyes, a cold smile played at h is l ips. Th e
kind of face it was hard to remember, especially since it was h i s unusual
c lothes that caught th e eye . Put another set of cl othes on him and you might
not eve n recognize the man.
"You know who 1 a m , 1 assu me?"
"No , sir, I ' m afra id 1 don 't," Nakata sa i d .
T h e man l ooked a bit let down b y th is. "Are y o u sure ? "
"Yes, 1 a m . 1 forgot t o mention i t , but Nakata isn 't very bright."
"You 've never seen me before?" the man sa id, rising from the chair to stand
sideways to Nakata , a leg raised as if he were walking. "Doesn 't ring a bell?"
"No, I ' m sorry. 1 don't recognize you."
"I see. Perhaps you 're not a wh isky drinker, then ," th e man sa i d .
"That's right. Nakata doesn 't drink or smoke . I ' m p o o r enough t o g e t a

sub city so 1 can't afford that."
The man sat back down and crossed his legs. H e p i cked up a glass on the
desk and took a sip of whisky. Ice cubes c l i nked in the glass. "I hope you don't
m i n d i f I indulge ? "
" N o , I d o n ' t mind. Pl ease feel free."
"Thank you ," the man sa id, gaz ing intently at Nakata . "So you really
don't know who I am."
''I ' m sorry, but I'm afraid I don't."
Th e man's l ips twisted slightly. For a brief moment a cold smile rose l ike
a distorted ripple on the sur face of water, vanished, then rose up aga i n . "Any­
one who e n j oys whisky would recognize me right away, but never m i n d . My
name is Johnnie Walker. Johnnie Walker. Most everyon e knows who I a m .
N o t t o boast, b u t I ' m famous a l l over the worl d . A n iconic figure, you might
say. I'm not the real Johnnie Walker, mind you . I have noth i n g to d o with the

1 1 6

British disti l l i ng company. I 've j ust borrowed his appearance and n a m e .
A person 's g o t t o have a n appearance and name, a m I right?"
S i l e n c e descended on the room . Nakata had no idea what the man
was talking about, th ough he did catch the name Johnnie Walker. "Are you a
foreigner, Mr. J o h n n i e Walker?"
Johnnie Walker i n c l ined h is head. "We l l , if that helps you understand
m e , feel free to th ink so . Or not. Because both are true ."
Nakata was l ost. He might as well be talking with Kawamur a , the cat.
"So you 're a foreigner, but also not a foreigner. Is that what you m e a n ? "
"That is correct."
Nakata didn't pursue the point. "Did you have th is dog bring m e
h e r e , th e n ? "
" I did," J o h n n i e Walker repl ied simply.
"Wh ich means . . . that maybe you have someth ing you 'd l ike to
ask me?"
" It's more l ike y o u have someth ing to ask

me,

"

Johnnie Walker repl i e d ,

then took another s i p of his whisky. "As I understand i t , you 've been waiting
i n that vacant lot for several days for me to show up."
"Yes, that's right. I compl etely forgot! Nakata 's not too bright, and I forget
th ings quickly. I t's j ust l ike you sa i d . I 've been wa iting for you in that vacant
lot to ask you about a missing cat."
Johnnie Walker tapped h is black walking stick smartly agai nst the side of
his black boots, and the dry cl ick filled th e room . The black d og's ears
twi tched. "The su n 's setting, the tide's goi ng out. So why don't we c u t to the
chase ," Johnnie Walker sa i d . "You wanted to see m e because of th is cat?"
"Yes, that's correct. Mrs. Koizu mi asked Nakata to find her, and I 've been
looking all over for Coma for the past ten days or so . Do you know Coma?"
" I know her very wel l ."
"And do you know where she might be?"
" I do indeed."
Lips sl ightly parted, Nakata stared at the silk hat, th e n back at h is fac e .
J o h n n i e Walker's th i n l i ps were tightly closed , with a confident look.
" I s she nearby? "
Johnnie Walker nodded a few times. "Yes, very near."
Nakata gazed around the room , but couldn't see any cats. Only th e writ­
ing desk, the swivel c h a i r th e man was seated o n , the sofa he h i mself was o n ,
two more c h a i rs, t h e fl o o r l a m p , a n d a coffee tabl e . " S o can I take C o m a
home?" Nakata aske d .
"That all depends on you."

117

"On Nakata ? "
"C orrect. I t's all up t o you,

"

Johnnie Walker sa i d , one eyebrow raised

sl ightly. "If you make up your mind to do it, you can take Coma back h o m e .
A n d make Mrs. Koizumi a n d h e r daughters happy. Or y o u can n ever take her
back, and break their hearts. You wouldn't want to do that, I imagi n e ? "
" N o , Nakata doesn 't want t o disappoint th e m . "
" T h e same with m e . I d o n ' t want t o disappoint th e m either."
"So what should I do?"
Johnnie Walker twirled the walking stick. " I want you to do someth i ng
for m e . "
" Is i t someth ing that Nakata c a n d o ? "
" I never ask th e i mpossibl e . That's a colossal waste of ti m e , don't you
agree?"
Nakata gave it some thought. " I suppose so ."
"Wh ich means that what I'm asking you to do is someth i n g you 're capable of doing."
Nakata pondered this. "Yes, I 'd say that's true . "
"As a rul e , there's always cou nterevidence for every theory."
" B eg pardon?" Nakata sa i d .
" For every th eory there h a s t o be counterevidence - othe rwise sci e n c e
wouldn't progress," J o h n n i e Walker sa i d , defiantly tapp ing his stick aga i nst
h is boots. The dog perked up his ears aga i n . "Not at a l l . "
Nakata kept quiet.
"Truth be tol d , I 've been looking for someone l ike you for a long time,"
Johnnie Walker sa i d . "But it wasn 't easy to find th e right perso n . Th e oth e r
day, th ough , I saw y o u talking t o a c a t and it h i t me - th is is t h e exact person
I 've been looking for. That's why I 've had you come all th is way. I feel bad
about having you go to all the troubl e , though ."
" N o trouble at all. Nakata has plenty of free time."
'Tve prepared a couple of th eories about you," Johnnie Walker sa i d .
"And of course several pieces o f counte revidence. I t's l ike a gam e , a mental
gam e I play. But every game needs a winner and a l oser. I n th is case , winning
and losing i nvolves determining wh ich theory is correct and wh ich theories
aren't. But I don't i magine you understand what I ' m talking about."
S i l e ntly, Nakata shook his head.
Johnnie Walker tapped his walking stick aga i nst his boots twi c e , a signal
for the dog to stand up.

Chapter I S

O

sh i m a c l i m bs into his M i ata and fl ips on the headlights. As he steps
on th e gas, pebbles shoot up, scraping th e bottom of the car. H e
backs u p ,th en turns around t o face the roa d . H e raises h is h a n d i n

farewel l , a n d I do t h e sa me. The brake l i ghts a r e swallowed up i n darkness,
the sound of the engine fading. Then it's completely gone,and the silence of
th e forest takes over.
I go back i n to the cabin and bolt the door shut from the i n s i d e . Like it
was lying i n wait for me, silence wraps i tself around m e tightly once I ' m
a l o n e . T h e night a i r's s o c o l d it's hard t o bel ieve it's early summer,but i t's too
late to l ight the stove . Al l I can do is crawl inside my sleeping bag and get
some sl eep. My m i n d 's a l ittle spacey from lack of sleep and my musc l es ache
from bouncing around in the car so long. I turn down the l ight o n the lamp.
The room dims as the shadows that fill the corners grow more i ntense . I t's too
much trouble to change clothes, so I crawl into my sleeping bag with my
j eans and yacht j acket on.
I cl ose my eyes but can't fal l asleep, my body dying for rest wh i l e my
mind's wide awake . A b i rd occasionally breaks the silence of the night. Other
sounds filte r i n too, th ings I can't identify. Someth i ng tra m p l i n g on fal l e n
leaves. Someth i ng heavy rustl ing t h e branches. T h e sound of a deep breath .
The occasi onal ominous creak of floorboards on th e porc h . They sound l ike
they're right near the cabin, an army of invisible c reatu res that popul ates the
darkness and has m e surrounded.
And I feel l ike somebody's watching me. My skin smarts with the sense of
eyes boring i n on me. My heart beats out a hollow th ump. Several times from
inside the sl eeping bag I open my eyes a sl it and peer around the dimly lit room
j ust to be sure no one else is th ere . The front door's bolted with that heavy bolt,
and the th ick curtains at the windows are sh ut tight. So I ' m okay, I tell myself.
I'm alone in th is room and no one's gaz ing in at me through the windows.
But stil l I can't shake the feeling that I ' m being watched . My throat's

119

parched and I ' m having trouble breath i ng. I need to drink som e water,but i f
I do I ' l l n e e d t o take a l e a k a n d that means goi ng outside. I have t o h o l d on till
morni ng. C ur l e d up in my sleeping bag, I give a small shake of my head.

Are you kidding me? You 're like some scared little kid, afraid of the silence
and the dark. You 're not going to wimp out on me now, are you ? You always
thought you were tough , but when it hits the fan, you look like you 're about
to burst into tears . Look at you

-

I bet you 're going to wet your bed!

Ignoring h i m,I c lose my eyes tight,zip the bag up to j ust below my n ose,and
clear my head. I don't open my eyes for anyth i n g - not wh en I hear a n owl
hooti ng, not when someth ing lands with a th ud on the ground outside. Not
even when I sense someth ing moving inside the cabin. I'm being tested, I tel l
myself. Osh ima spent a few days alone here too,w h e n h e was about my age.
H e must have been scared out of his wits,sa me as me. That's what he meant
by solitude comes in different varieties. Osh ima knows exactly how I feel being
here alone at night, because he's gone through the sam e th i ng, and felt the
sam e emotions. Th is thought helps me relax a l i ttle. I feel l ike I can trac e the
shadows of the past that l i nger here and imagine mysel f as a part of it. I take a
deep breath,and I fal l asleep before I know it.

It's after six a.m. when I wake up. The a i r is filled with a shower of b i rd calls.
The b i rds busily fl i t from branch to branch,calling out to each other i n p i e rc­
ing c h i rps. Th eir m essage has none of the deep echo and h i dden i m p l i ca­
tions of those the night before. Wh en I pull back the c ur t a ins,every bit of l ast
night's darkness has disappeared from around the cabin. Everyth ing sparkles
in a newborn golden gl ow. I l ight the stove, boil some m i n e ral water, and
make a cup of chamomile tea, then open a box of c rackers and have a few
with cheese. After that I brush my teeth at the sink and wash my face.
I pull on a windbreaker over my yacht j acket and go outside. Th e morn­
ing l ight pours down through the tall trees onto the open space in front of th e
cabin,sunbeams everywh ere and mist floating l ike fresh ly minted souls. The
pure clean air pi erces my lungs with each breath. I sit down on a porch step
and watch the b i rds sc udding from tree to tree,l istening to th eir calls. Most of
th e m move about i n pai rs, constantly checking to see where their partn e r is,
screeching out to keep in touch.

I fol l ow the sound of the water and find the stream right away, cl ose by.
Rocks form a kind of pool where the water flows in,swirling around in a maze
of eddies before rush i n g back out to re join the stre a m . The wate r is clear and
beautifu l . I scoop some up to drink - it's cold and delicious - an d then hold
my hands i n the c u rrent.
Back at the cabin I cook ham and eggs i n the frying pan,make som e toast
using a metal n et, and heat milk in a small pan to wash down my meal . Afte r
eating I haul a c h a i r out to the porch, prop my legs tip on the ra i l i ng, and
spend the morning readi ng. Osh i m a 's bookshelf is crammed fu l l of hun­
dreds of books. Only a few are novels, chiefly classics. Mostly they're books
on philosophy, sociology, history, geography, natural sciences, economics ­
a huge number of sub jects, a random selection of fields. Osh ima sa i d
he'd hardly attended school at a l l , s o t h i s must have been h ow h e g o t h is
education.
I pick out a book on the trial of Adolf E ichmann . I have a vague notion of
him as a Nazi war criminal, but no special interest i n the guy. The book j ust
happens to catch my eye, is a l l . I start to read and learn how th is totally prac­
tical l i e utenant colonel in the SS, with his metal-fra me glasses and th i n n i n g
hair,was,s o o n a ft e r t h e w a r started,assigned b y N a z i headqua rte rs t o design
a "fi nal soluti o n " for the J ews - extermination, that is - and h ow h e investi­
gated the best ways of actually carrying th is out. Apparently i t barely crossed
his mind to question th e mora l i ty of what he was doi ng. Al l he cared about
was how best,i n the shortest period of time and for the lowest possible cost,to
dispose of the Jews. And we're talking about eleven m i l l i o n Jews he figured
needed to be e l i m i nated in E u rope.
E i chmann studied how many Jews could be packed i n to each ra i l road
car, what percentage would die of "natural" causes wh i l e being tra nsported,
the minimal number of people needed to keep th is operati on going. Th e
cheapest method of disposing of the dead bodies - burni ng, or bur ying, or
dissolving the m . Seated at his desk E i chmann pored over all these numbers.
Once he put i t into operation, everyth ing went pretty much acc ording to
plan. By the end of the war some six million J ews had been disposed of.
Strangely, the guy n ever fel t any remorse . S i tting in court in Tel Aviv,b e h i n d
bulletproof glass, E ichmann looked l ike he c o u l d n ' t for t h e l i fe of h i m figure
out why he was being tried,or why the eyes of the world were upon h i m. He
was j ust a tec h n i cian, he i nsisted, who'd found the m ost efficient solution to
the problem assigned h i m. Wasn 't he doing j ust what any good bureau c rat
would do? S o why was he being singled out and accused?
S i tting i n the qu iet woods with birds c h i rping all aro u n d me, I read the

12 1

story of this practical guy. In the back of the book there's a penciled n ote
Osh ima had writte n . His handwriting's pretty easy to spot: It's all a question of

imagination. Our responsibility begins with the power to imagine. It's just like
Yeats said: In dreams begin responsib i l i ti es. Flip this around and you could
say that where there's no power to imagine, no responsibility can arise. Just like
we see with E ichmann.
I try to picture Osh ima sitting in th is chair, his usual nicely sharpened
pencil i n hand, looking back over th is book and writi ng down his i mpres­
sions. In dreams begin responsibilities. The words h i t home.
I shut th e book, lay it on my lap, and th ink about my own responsib i l i ty.
I can't help it. My white T-sh irt was soaked in fresh blood. I washed the blood
away with these hands, so much blood the sink turned red . I imagine I'll be
held responsible for all that blood . I try to p icture mysel f being tried i n a
court, my acc users doggedly trying to pin the blame on m e , angrily pointing
fi ngers and glaring at m e . I insist that you can't be held responsible for some­
th ing you can't remember. I don't have any idea what really took place, I tel l
the m . But they counter with this: " I t doesn 't matter whose d r e a m i t started
out as, you have the same drea m . So you 're responsible for whatever happens
i n the drea m . That dream crept inside you , right down th e dark corridor of
your sou ! ."
Just l ike Adolf E ichmann, caught up - whether he l iked it or not - i n the
twisted dreams of a man named H itler.

I put th e book down , stand up, and stretch . I have been reading for a l o n g
time and need t o g e t up and move around a l i ttl e . I take t h e a l u m i nu m p a i l
by t h e sink and g o t o t h e stream t o fill it. Next I take a n a r m l o a d of fi rewood
fro m the shed i n back and set it by the stove .
I n a corner of the porch there's a faded nylon rope for hanging out laun­
dry. I pull out my damp clothes from my backpack, smooth out a l l the wrin­
kles, and hang th e m up to dry. I take everyth ing else out of the pack and lay it
out on the bed, th en sit down at the desk and fi l l in my diary for the last few
days. I use a pen with a fine tip and write down in small letters everyth i n g
that's happened t o m e . I d o n ' t know how l o n g I ' l l remember a l l t h e deta i ls, so
I better get them down as fast as I can. I search my memory. H ow I l ost con­
sciollsn ess and came to i n the woods behind a shri n e . The darkness and my
blood-soaked sh i rt. Phoning Sakura , spending the night at her place . H ow we
talked, how she did that to me.

12 2

She'd said, I don 't get it, you don 't have to tell me that! Why don't you
j ust go ahead and imagine what you want? You don't need my permission.
How can I know what's in your head?

But she got it wrong. What I i magine is perhaps very i m portant. For the
entire worl d .

That afternoon I d e c i d e t o g o into t h e woods. Osh ima sa i d t h a t goi ng t o o far
i nto the forest is dangerous. Always keep the cabin in sight, he warned m e .
But I ' l l probably be here for a few days, a n d I sh ould know someth i n g about
th is massive wall of a forest that surrounds me. Bette r to know a l i ttl e , J figure ,
than noth i n g at all . E mpty-handed, I say good-bye to th e sunny lot and step
into the gloomy sea of trees.
Th ere's a kind of rough path trod down through the forest, m ostly fol low­
ing the lay of the l a n d , but i mproved here and th ere with a few flat rocks l a i d
down l ike stepping stones. Places prone t o erosi on have been n e atly but­
tressed with wooden planks, so th at even if the weeds grow over it you can sti l l
follow t h e path . Maybe Osh ima 's brother worked on t h e path l i ttle b y l i ttle
each time he stayed here. I fol l ow it into the woods, uphill at fi rst, then it goes
down and ski rts around a h igh boulder before c l i m b i ng up aga i n . Overall it's
mostly uph i l l , but not a very tough c l i m b . Tal l trees l i n e both sides, with d u l l­
colored tru nks, th ick branches growing out every wh ich way, dense l eaves
overh ead. The ground is covered with undergrowth and ferns that have man­
aged to soak up as much of th e fa int l ight as they can. I n places wh e re the su n
doesn 't reach , m oss has silently covered th e rocks.
Like someone excitedly relating a story only to find the words petering
out, the path gets narrower the farth er I go , the undergrowth taking over.
B eyond a certa i n point it's hard to tell if it's really a path or someth i n g that
j ust vaguely resembles one. Eventually it's completely swallowed up in a sea
of ferns. Maybe the path does continue up ahead, but I decide to save that
explorati on for n ext time. I don't have on the right kind of cl othes and haven't
really prepared for that.
I come to a halt and turn arou nd. Suddenly noth i ng l ooks fam i l iar,
there 's noth i n g I can c l i n g to . A tangle of tree tru nks ominously blocks the
view. I t's d i m , the air filled with a stagnant green, and not a b i rd to be heard.
I'm suddenly covered in goosebull1ps, but th ere's noth i ng to worry about,
I tel l myself. The path is right over there . As long as I don't l ose sight of that
I'll be able to return to the l i ght. Eyes glued to the ground, I carefully retrace

12 3

my steps and, after much l onger than it took me to get here, finally a rrive
back i n front of the cab i n . The lot is filled with bright, early-summer s u n l i ght,
and th e clear calls of b i rds echo as they search for food . Everyth ing's exactly
the same as I left it. Or at least I think it is. Th e chair I was sitting on i s sti l l on
the porc h . The book I was readi ng is facedown l ike I left it.
Now I know exactly how dangerous the forest can b e . And I hope I never
forget it. Just l ike C row said, the world's filled with th ings I don't know about.
All the plants and trees there , for instance. I 'd never imagined that trees could
be so weird and unearthly. I mean, the only plants I 've ever really seen or
touched till now are th e city kind - neatly trimmed and cared-for bushes and
trees. But the ones here - the ones living here - are totally different. They
have a physical power, their breath graz ing any humans who might chance
by, their gaze zeroing i n on the intruder l ike they've spotted their prey. Like
they have some dark, prehistoric, magical powers. Like deep-sea c reatures
rule the ocean depths, i n the forest trees reign supre m e . I f it wanted to , the
forest could re j ect me - or swallow me up wh ole. A healthy amount of fea r
and respect m i g h t be a good i d e a .
I g o b a c k t o th e cab i n , take m y compass o u t of my backpack, and check
that the needle's showing north . It might come in handy someti me, so I slip it
i n my pocket. I go sit on the porch , gaze at the woods, and l isten to C ream and
Duke E l l i ngton on my Walkman, songs I recorded off a l ibra ry's collection of
C Ds . I play "C rossroads" a couple of times. Music helps me calm down , but I
can't l isten for very long. Th ere's no el ectri city here and no way to recharge
the batteries, so once my extra batte ries are dead the mus i c 's over for good .

I work out a bit before dinner. Push-ups, sit-ups, squats, handstands, different
kinds of stretc h i n g exercises - a routi ne that keeps you i n shape without any
machines or equipment. Kind of boring, I ' l l admit, but you get a decent
workout. A tra i n e r at the gym taught me the routi n e . " Prisoners i n s o l i ta ry
confinement l ike th is best," he explained, calling it the "worl d 's lonel iest
workout routi n e ." I focus on what I ' m doing and go through a couple of sets,
my shirt getting sweaty in the process .
After a simple dinner I go out on the porch and gaze up at the stars twin­
kling above , the random scattering of mill ions of stars . Even i n a planetari um
you wou l d n 't find th is many. Some of th em look really b i g and disti nct, l ike if
you reached your hand out intently you could touch th e m . The whole th i n g
is breathtaking.
Not j ust beautifu l , though - the stars are l ike the trees i n the forest, al ive

and breath i ng. And they're watching me. What I 've done up ti l l n ow, what
I'm goi ng to do - they know it all. Noth ing gets past th eir watchfu l eye s . As I
sit there under the shining night sky, aga i n a violent fea r takes hold of m e . My
heart's pounding a mile a mi nute , and I can barely breath e . All th ese m i l l i o n s
of stars l o o k i n g down on m e , and I 've never given t h e m more tha n a passi n g
th ought before . Not j ust stars - h ow m a n y other th i ngs have n ' t I I10ticecl i n
th e worl d , th ings I know noth i n g about? I suddenly feel helpless, compl etely
powerless . And 1 know I ' l l never outrun that awful fee l i ng.
Back inside the cabin, I carefully arrange some fi rewood i n the stove , ball
up a few sheets of a n old newspaper, l ight it, and make sure the wood catches
fire. I n grade school I was sent to camp, and learned how to build a fi r e . 1
hated camp, but at least one good th ing came out of it, 1 suppose . I open the
damper to let the smoke out. I t doesn't go well at fi rst, but when a p i e c e of
kindling catches the fire spreads to the other sticks . I shut the door on the
stove and scrape a c h a i r over i n front of it, set a lamp nearby, and pick up
where I 'd left off in the book. Once th e fire 's built up a bit 1 set a kettl e of
water on top to boil , and after a wh i l e the kettl e burbles pleasantly.
Back to E i c h m a n n . Of course his proj ect didn't always go according to
plan. Conditions at various sites slowed th i ngs down . Wh en th is happened h e
acted l ike a human being - at least a l i ttl e . H e got angry, is w h a t I ' m saying.
H e grew incensed at these uncerta in elements that threw h i s elegant solution
into disarray. Tra i n s ran late . B ur e a u c ratic red tape held th i n gs u p . People in
charge were replaced, and relations with th eir successors didn't go wel l . After
the collapse of the Russ ian front, concentration camp guards were sent there
to fight. There were h eavy sn owfalls. Power outages. Not e n ough poison gas
to go aro u n d . Ra i l l i nes were bombed . Eichmann hated th e war itself- that
element of u n ce rta inty that screwed up his plans.
At h i s trial he described all th is, no emotion showing on his fac e . H i s
recall was amazing. H i s l i fe was entirely made up of th ese deta i l s .
A t t e n 1 put t h e b o o k down , brush my teeth , and wash my fa c e . T h e fi re
bathes the room i n an orange gl ow, and the pleasant warmth calms my
tension and fear. I snuggle into my sleeping bag d ressed only i n a T-s h i rt a n d
boxers. Compare d t o l a s t night I ' m a b l e t o shut my eyes easily. Thoughts of
Sakura c ross my m i n d .
" I w a s th inking h o w nice it'd be if I w a s y o u r real sister," she'd s a i d .
None of th at tonight. I 've g o t t o g e t s o m e s l e e p . A log topples over i n the
stove , a n owl hoots outs i d e . And I topple down into a n i ndistinct dream .

125

Th e next day's the same. B i rds wake me up a l i ttl e after six. I boil some water,
make a cup of tea , and have breakfast. Read on the porc h , l isten to musi c , go
fi l l up the water pail at the stream. And I walk down the path into the woods,
th is time carrying my compass, glancing at it every once i n a wh i l e to get a
general idea of where the cabin i s . I found a hatchet i n the shed and use i t
t o c h o p s i mple hatch marks on trees. I c l e a r out some of t h e underbrush to
make the path easier to follow.
Just l ike yesterday the forest is dark and deep, the towering trees forming
a th ick wall on both sides. Someth i ng of the forest is h iding th ere, i n the dark­
ness between the trees, l ike some 3-D painting of an animal , watc h i n g my
every move . But the fear that made me shudder isn't there anymore . I 've made
my own rules, and by following th em I won't get lost. At least I hope not.
I come to th e place where I stopped yesterday and forge on, stepp ing i n to
the sea of ferns. After a wh ile the path reemerges, and aga i n I ' m surrounded
by a wall of trees, on whose trunks I hack out some markings as I go . Some­
where i n the branches above me a huge bird flaps i ts wi ngs , but l ooking up
I can't spot it. My mouth is dry.
I walk on for a wh i l e and reach a round sort of clearing. Surrounded by
tall trees, it l ooks l ike the bottom of a gigantic wel l . S u n l i ght shoots down
through the branches l ike a spotl ight illuminating the ground at my feet. The
place feels speci a l , somehow. I sit down i n the sunl ight and let the fa i n t
warmth wash over me, taking o u t a chocolate b a r from my pocket and e n j oy­
i n g the sweet taste . Realizing all over aga i n how i mportant s u n l i ght is to
human beings, I appreciate each second of that precious l ight. The intense
lonel iness and helplessness I felt under those m i l l i on s of stars has vanish e d .
But as t i m e passes, th e sun's angle shifts a n d t h e l ight disappears . I stand up
and retrace th e path back to the cab i n .

I n t h e afternoon dark clouds suddenly color t h e sky a mysterious s h a d e a n d i t
starts ra ining h a r d , pounding t h e roof and windows of th e cab i n . I strip naked
and run outs i d e , wash ing my face with soap and scrubbing myself all over. I t
feels wonderfu l . I n my j oy I s h u t m y eyes and s h o u t out meani ngless words as
the large raindrops strike me on the cheeks , the eyelids, chest, side, penis,
legs, and butt - the stinging pa in l ike a rel igious i nitiation or someth i n g .
A l o n g with t h e pain th ere's a feeling of closeness, l ike for once i n my l i fe the
worl d 's treating me fa i rly. I feel elated, as if all of a sudden I 've been set free .
I fac e th e sky, hands held wide apart, open my mouth wide, a n d gulp down
the fal l i n g ra i n .

Back inside the hut, I dry off with a towel , sit down on the bed, and look
at my penis - a l i ght-col ored , healthy, youthful penis. Th e head stil l sti n gs a
l ittl e fro m the ra i n . For a long wh i l e I stare at this strange organ that, most
of the time, has a mind of i ts own and contemplates thoughts not shared by
my bra i n .
I wonder i f Osh i m a , whe n he was m y age a n d stayed here, struggl ed with
sexual desire. H e must have , but I can't pi cture h i m taking care of busi ness
on h i s own . H e 's too detached, too cool for that.
" I was different from everybody else," he'd s a i d . I don't know what that
means, but I ' m sure he wasn't j ust spouti ng someth i n g off the top of his h e a d .
H e didn't s a y i t t o be mysterious and coy, either.
I consider j e rking off but th ink better of it. Being pummeled by the ra i n
so hard m a d e m e feel strangely purified, a n d I want t o h o l d o n t o that sensa­
tion a wh i l e l onger. I pull on some boxers, take a few deep breath s , and start
doing squats . A h undred squats later I do a hundred sit-up s . I focus on o n e
m u s c l e group at a t i m e . O n c e m y routi ne's done, my m i n d 's c l e a r . The ra i n 's
stopped, the s u n 's starti ng to shine through breaks in the clouds, a n d the b i rds
have started c h i rping aga i n .

B ut that c a l m won't last long, you know. It's like beasts that never tire,
tracking you everywhere you go. They come out at you deep in the forest.
They're tough, relentless, merciless, untiring, and they never give up. You
might control yourself now, and not masturbate , but they'll get you in the
end, as a wet dream. You might dream about raping your sister, your
mother. It's not something you can control. It's a power beyond you - and
all you can do is accept it.
You 're afraid of imagination. And even more afraid of dreams. Afraid
of the responsibility that begins in dreams. B ut you have to sleep, and
dreams are a part of sleep. \\'hen you 're awake you can suppress imagina­
tion. B ut you can't suppress dreams.

I l i e down i n bed and l i sten to Pri nce on my headphones, concentrati ng on
th is strangely unceasing mus i c . The batteries run out i n the middle of " L i ttle
Red C o rvette ," the music disappearing l ike it's been swall owed up by qu i ck­
sand. I yank off my headphones and l iste n . S i l e n c e , I discover, is someth i n g
you c a n actually hear.

Chapter 16

T

he black d o g stood up a n d l e d Nakata o u t of t h e study a n d down the
dark corridor to the kitchen, wh ich had only a couple of windows and
was dark. Though it was neat and clean, it had a n i nert fee l , l ike a

science lab in school . The dog stopped in front of the doors of a large refriger­
ator, turned around, and drilled Nakata with a cold look
Open the left door, he said in a low voice. Nakata knew it wasn't the dog

talking but Johnnie Walker, speaking to Nakata through h i m . Looking at
Nakata through the dog's eyes.
Nakata did as he was tol d . Th e avocado green refrigerator was taller tha n
he was, and when he opened the left door th e thermostat c a m e on with a
th ump, the motor groaning to l i fe . Wh ite vapor, l ike fog, wafted out. Th i s
side of t h e refrigerator w a s a freezer, at a very l ow setti ng.
Inside was a row of about twenty rou n d , fru it-l ike objects , n eatly
arranged . Noth i n g else. Nakata bent over and l ooked at th em fixedly. Wh e n
t h e vapor c leared h e saw i t wasn't fru it at all but t h e severed h e a d s of cats .
C ut-off heads of all colors a n d sizes, arranged on three shelves l ike oranges a t
a fru i t stand . T h e cats' faces were froze n , facing forward. Nakata gulped.
Take a good look, the dog commanded. Check with your own eyes
whether Coma's in there or not.

Nakata did th i s , examining the cats' heads one by o n e . He didn't feel
afra i d - h i s mind focused on finding the missing l i ttle cat. Nakata carefu l l y
ch ecked each head, confirming that Coma 's wasn't among the m . No doubt
about i t - not a singl e tortoiseshell. The faces of the bodyless cats had a
strangely vacant express ion, not one of them appearing to have suffered .
That, at least, brought Nakata a sigh of rel ief. A few of the cats had th eir eyes
closed, but most were staring out blankly at a point in spac e .
" I d o n ' t s e e C o m a here," Nakata s a i d i n a flat ton e . H e cleared h i s throat
and shut th e refrigerator door.
Are you absolutely sure?

"Yes, I ' m sure."
The dog stood up and led Nakata back to th e study. J o h n n i e Walker was
still seated i n the swivel chair, waiting for h i m . As Nakata entere d , he
touched th e brim of his silk hat i n greeti ng and smiled pleasantly. Then
he clapped his hands loudly, twi c e , and the dog left the room .
" I ' m the o n e who cut off all th ose cats' heads," h e s a i d . H e l i fted h i s glass
of whi sky and took a drink. ' ' I ' m collecting th em."
" S o you 're the one who's been catch ing cats i n that vacant lot and killing
the m . "
"That's right. T h e infamous cat-killer Johnnie Walker, at y o u r servi c e . "
" N akata d o e s n ' t understand th is so well , so do y o u m i n d i f I a s k a
questi o n ? "
" B e my guest," Johnnie Walker said, l ifting h i s glass. " Feel fre e t o a s k any­
th ing. To save time, though , if you don't mind, I can guess that the fi rst th i n g
y o u wa nt t o know is why I have t o kill all th ese cats . Why I ' m colle cting th eir
heads . Am I right?"
"Yes, that's right. That's what Nakata wants to know."
Johnnie Walker set his glass down on the desk and l o oked stra ight at
Nakata. 'Th i s i s an important secret I wouldn't tel l j ust a nybody. For you ,
Mr. Nakata , I ' l l make a n excepti o n , but I don't want you tel l i n g oth e r peopl e .
Not that they'd b e l i eve you even if you did." H e chuckled.
"Listen - I ' m not k i l l i ng cats j ust for the fun of it. I ' m not so disturbed I
find it amusi ng," he went on. " I ' m not j ust some dilettante with time on h i s
hands. I t takes a lot of t i m e a n d effort t o gather and kill th is m a n y cats . I ' m
k i l l i ng the m t o collect their souls, wh ich I u s e t o create a special k i n d of fl ute .
And when I blow that flute it'll let me collect even larger soul s . Then I collect
larger souls and make an even higger flute . Perhaps in the end I ' l l be able to
make a fl ute so large it'll rival the universe . But first come the cats . Gathering
th eir souls is the starti ng point of the whol e pro j ect. Th ere 's a n essential order
you have to fol l ow i n everyth ing. It's a way of showing respect, fol l owing every­
th ing in the correct order. It's what you need to do when you 're dealing with
other souls. It's not p i neapples and melons I ' m working with here , agreed?"
"Yes," Nakata repl i e d . But actually he had no idea. A flute? Was h e talk­
ing about a fl u te you held s i deways? Or maybe a recorder? What sort of sound
would i t make? And what did he mean by cats' souls? All of th is exceeded h is
l i mited powers of comprehension. But Nakata did understand one th ing: h e
h a d t o l ocate G o m a and get her o u t of here .
"What you want to do is take Goma home," Johnnie Walker sa i c! , as
though reading Nakata 's m i n d .

12 9

"That's right. Nakata wants to take Coma back to her home."
"That's your miss i o n ," Johnnie Walker said. "We all fol l ow our mission i n
l i fe . That's natura l . Now I imagine you 've never heard a Aute made o u t o f
cats' souls, have you ? "
" N o , I haven 't."
"Of course you haven't. You can't hear it with your ears."
" I t's a Aute you can't hear?"
" C o rrect. I can hear it, of course," Johnnie Walker said. "If I don't hear i t
none of th is w o u l d work . Ordi nary peopl e, th ough , can't detect it. E v e n i f
they do hear i t , they d o n ' t real ize it. They m a y have heard it i n t h e p a s t but
don't remember. A very strange Aute, for sure. But maybe - j ust maybe - you
might be able to hear it, Mr. Nakata. If ! had a Aute on me right n ow we could
try it, but I ' m afra id I don't." Th en, as if recal l ing someth ing, he pointed o n e
fi n g e r straight up. "Actually, I w a s about t o cut off t h e h e a d s of th e cats I 've
rounded up. Harvest time. I 've got all the cats that can be caught in that
vacant l ot, and it's time to move on. The cat you 're looking for, Coma, is
among th e m . Of course i f ! cut her head off, you wouldn't be able to take her
home to the Koizumis, now would you ? "
"That's right," Nakata said. He couldn't take b a c k Coma's cut-off head to
the Koizu mis. If those two l i ttle girls saw that they might give up eati n g
forever.
"I want to cut off Coma's head, but you don't want that to happe n . O u r
two m i s s i o n s , our two interests , conAict. That happens a lot i n t h e worl d . S o
I ' l l tel l you what - we'll negotiate . What I mean i s , i f you do someth i n g for
m e , I ' l l return th e favor and give you Coma safe and sound."
Nakata l ifted a hand above his head and vigorously rubbed h i s salt-and­
pepper hair, his hab itual pose when puzzling over someth i ng. "Is i t some­
th ing I can do?"
" I thought we'd al ready settl ed that," Johnnie Walker said with a wry
smile.
"Yes, we did," Nakata said, remembering. "That's correct. We did settl e
that already. Pardon m e ."
"We don't have a lot of time, so let me jump to the conclusion, if you
don't mind. What you can do for me is kill

me.

Take my l i fe , i n other words."

Hand resting on the top of his head, Nakata stared at Johnnie Walker for
a long time. "You want Nakata to kill you ? "
"That's right," J o h n n i e Walker s a i d . "Truthfully, I ' m sick and tired of th is
l i fe . I 've l ived a long, long time. 1 don't even remember how old I a m . And I

13°

don't feel l ike l iving any longer. I'm sick and ti red ofkilling cats, but as long as
I l ive that's what I have to do - murder one cat after another and harvest th eir
souls. Following th ings i n the correct order, step one to step te n , the n back to
one aga i n . An endl ess repetiti on. And I 've had it! Nobody respects what I ' m
doing, it doesn't make anybody happy. But t h e whole th ing's all fi x e d al ready.
I can't j ust suddenly say I quit and stop what I ' m doing. And taking my own
l i fe isn't an optio n . That's already been decided too . Th ere 're all sorts of rules
i nvolved. If I want to die, I have to get somebody else to kill m e . That's where
you come in. I want you to fear me, to hate me with a passion - and th en
terminate m e . First you fear m e . Then you hate me. And finally you kill me."
" B u t why - why ask me? Nakata's never ever killed anyone before. I t's not
the kind of th i n g I'm su ited for."
"I know. You 've n ever killed anyone, and don't want to . But l isten to
m e - there are times in l i fe when th ose kinds of exc uses don't cut it anymore .
S i tuations when n obody cares whether you 're s u i ted for the task at hand or
not. I need you to understand that. For instance, it happens i n war. Do you
know what war is?"
"Yes, I d o . There was a big war going on when Nakata was born . I heard
about it."
"When a war sta rts people are forced to become soldiers. They carry guns
and go to th e front lines and have to kill soldiers on the other side. As many as
they possibly can. Nobody cares whether you l ike killing other people or not.
I t's j ust someth i ng you have to do. Otherwise you're th e one who gets killed."
Johnnie Walker pointed his index finger at Nakata's chest. " B a n g ! " he s a i d .
" H u m a n h i story i n a nutshe l l . "
" I s t h e Gove rnor g o i n g t o make Nakata a s o l d i e r and o r d e r m e t o k i l l
peopl e ? "
"Ye s , that's w h a t t h e Governor will do. Tell y o u t o kill som ebody."
Nakata thought about th is but couldn't qu i te figure it out. Why i n the
world would the Governor do that?
"You 've got to look at it th is way: th is is war. You 're a soldier, and you h ave
to make a decision. E ither I kill the cats or you kill m e . One or the other. You
need to make a choice right here and now. This might seem an outrageous
choice, but consider th is: most choices we make i n l i fe are equally Olltra­
geous." Johnnie Walker lightly touched his silk hat, as i f making sure it was
still i n place.
"The one savi ng grace fo r you here - if i ndeed you need such a th i n g ­
is the fact that I want t o d i e . I 've asked you t o k i l l m e , so y o u don't n e e d to

suffer any pangs of consci ence. You're doing exactly what I ' m hoping for. I t's
not l ike you 're k i l l i n g somebody who doesn't want to die. In fact, you 're doing
a good deed."
Nakata wiped away the beads of sweat that had formed on h i s h a i rl i n e .
" B u t th ere's no way Nakata could do something l ike that. Even i f y o u tel l me
to kill you , I don't know how to go about it."
"I hear you," Johnnie Walker said admiri ngly. "You 've never killed a ny­
body before, so you don't know how to go about it. All right th e n , let m e
expla i n . T h e knack t o k i l l i n g someone, M r . Nakata , is n o t t o hes itate . Focus
you r pre j udice and execute it swiftl y - that's the ticket wh en it comes to
k i l l i ng. I have an excellent example right here . It's not a person , but it might
help you get the picture."
Johnnie Walker stood up and pi cked up a large leather case from the
shadows below the desk. He placed it on the chair where h e 'd been sitting
and opened it, whistl i n g a cheery tun e . As i f performing a magic trick, he
extracted a cat from out of the case. Nakata had never seen th is cat before, a
gray-striped male that had just reached adulthood. The cat was l i m p , but i ts
eyes were ope n . It looked conscious, th ough only barely. Still whistl i n g h i s
merry tun e - " H e i gh-Ho " from Disney's Snow White, t h e one t h e Seven
Dwarves sang - Johnnie Walker held up the cat l ike he was showing off a fish
he'd j ust caught.
" I 've got five cats inside th is case, all from that vacant lot. A fresh batc h .
Just p i cked, fresh from the grove , s o to speak. I 've given them a l l i n j ections to
paralyze th e m . I t's not an an esth etic - they're not asleep and they can feel
pain, but they can't move their arms or legs. Or even th eir heads. I do th is to
keep them from thrash ing about. What I'm goi ng to do i s slice open their
ch ests with a knife , extract th eir still-beati ng hearts , and cut th eir heads off.
Right in front of your eyes. There'll be lots of blood, and uni maginable p a i n .
Imagine how m u c h it'd hurt if somebody c u t o p e n you r chest and p u l l e d out

your heart! Same th ing holds true for cats - i t's got to h u rt. I feel sorry for the
poor l i ttle th ings. I'm not some cold, cruel sadist, but there's noth i n g I can do
about it. There has to be pain. That's the rul e . Rules everywhe re you look
here." H e wi nked at Nakata . "A j ob's a job. Got to accomplish your miss i o n .
I ' m goi ng t o dispose of one c a t after another, a n d fi n i s h off Goma last. S o you
sti l l have some time to decide what you should clo. Remember, now - it's
either I kill the cats or you kill me. There's no other choice."
Johnnie Walker placed the l i mp cat on top of th e desk, opened a drawer,
and with both hands extracted a large black package . H e carefully u nwrapped
it and spread out the contents on th e desk. These included a small el ectric

saw, scalpels of various sizes, and a very large knife , all of th e m gl eaming l ike
they'd j ust been sharpe ned. Johnnie Walker l ovingly checked each and every
blade as he l i n e d th em up on the desk. Next he got several metal trays from
anoth er drawer and a rranged th e m , too , on the desk. The n h e took a large
black plastic bag from a drawer. All the wh i l e wh istl i n g " H ei gh-Ho . "
"As I mentioned, M r . Nakata , in everyth ing there's a proper order,"
Johnnie Walker said. "You can't look too far ahead. Do that and you ' l l lose
sight of what you 're doing and stumble. I'm not sayi ng you should focus
solely on deta i l s right i n front of you , mind you . You 've got to l ook ahead a bit
or else you ' l l bump into someth i ng. You 've got to fol l ow the proper order and
at the same time keep a n eye out for what's ahead . That's critica l , n o matter
what you 're doing."
Johnnie Walker narrowed h i s eyes and gently stroked the cat's head. He
ran the tip of his index fi nger up and down the cat's belly, th e n p i cked up a
scalpel i n h i s right hand and without any warning made an i n c i s i o n stra ight
down the sto m a c h . I t all happened in an i nstant. The belly spl it wide open
and reddish guts spilled out. The cat tried to scream but barely made any
sound at all. His tongue, after a l l , was numb, and he could hardly open his
mouth . B u t h i s eyes were contorted in te rrible pa i n . And Nakata could well
imagine h ow awful th is pa in was . A moment later blood gushed out, wetting
Johnnie Walker's hands and running down h i s vest. But h e didn't pay atten­
tion . Still to the accompaniment of " H eigh-H o ," he thrust his hand inside the
cat's body and with a small scalpel skillfully cut loose the tiny heart.
H e placed the gory lump on h i s palm and held it out for Nakata to see.
"Take a peek. It's sti l l beating."
Th e n , as i f i t were the most natural th ing in the worl d , h e popped the
heart into h i s mouth and began chewing silently, lei surely savoring the taste .
H i s eyes gl istcned l ike a child e n j oying a pastry hot from the ove n .
H e wiped t h e blood from h i s mouth with the back of h i s h a n d a n d care­
fully l i cked his l ips clean. " Fresh and warm . And sti ll beating i n my mouth ."
Nakata stared at the scene before h i m without a word . H e couldn't look
away. The smell of fresh blood filled the roo m .
S t i l l whistl ing h i s j olly tu n e , J o h n n i e Walker sawed t h e cat's head off.
Th e teeth of th e saw c ru n ched through the bone and severed it. H e seemed
to know exactly what h e was doing. The neck bone wasn't ve ry th ick, so the
wh ole operation was qui ckly finished. But the sound had a strange weight to
it. Johnnie Walker lovingly placed the severed head on th e metal tray. As i f
rel ish ing a work of a r t , he narrowed his eyes and gazed at it i n tently. H e
stopped whistl i ng for a second, extracted someth i n g stuck betwee n h is teeth

with a fingerna i l , popped it in his mouth and carefully tasted it, th e n
smacked h i s l ips, satisfied, a n d gulped it down . Next he o p e n e d t h e black
plastic bag and casually tossed in the dead cat's body l ike some useless shel l .
" O n e down ," Johnnie Walker s a i d , spreading h i s bloody h a n d s i n front o f
Nakata . " A bit of work, don't you th ink? You c a n e n j oy a nice fresh heart, b u t
look h o w bloody you get. No, this my hand will rather the multitudinous seas

incarnadine, making the green one red. A l i n e fro m Macbeth. Th is isn't as bad
as Macbeth, but you wouldn't bel ieve the dry-cleaning b i l l s . Th is i s a special
outfit, after all. I should wear a surgical gown and gloves, but I can't. Anoth e r

rule, I ' m afra id."
Nakata didn't say a word , th ough someth i n g was begi nning to stir in his
m i n d . The room smelled of blood, and strains of " H eigh-H o " rang i n h i s ears.
Johnnie Walker pulled out the next cat fro m h i s bag, a wh ite female, not
so young, with the tip of her tail bent a l i ttl e . As before, he stroked the cat's
head for a wh i l e , then leisurely traced an invisible l i n e down her stomach . H e
p i cked up a scalpel a n d again made a qu ick c u t t o open up the ch est. The rest
was the same as before . The silent scream , the convulsing body, guts spilling
out. Pull i n g out th e bloody heart, showing it to Nakata , popp ing it i n his
mouth , chewing it slowly. Th e satisfied smile. Wiping the blood away with
th e back of h i s hand. Al l with " H eigh-H o" as ba ckground mus i c .
Nakata sank back i n h i s c h a i r a n d closed h i s eyes. H e h e l d h is h e a d i n h i s
hands, t h e fi ngertips digging into his temples . Someth ing was definitely ris­
i n g up with i n h i m , a horrible confusion transforming his ve ry being. H e was
breath i n g rap idly, and a sharp pain throbbed i n his neck. His vision was
changing drastically.
" Mr. Nakata ," Johnnie Walker said brightly, "don't poop out on m e yet.
We 're j ust getti ng to th e main event. That was j ust the opening act, a m e re
warm-up. Now we 're getting to the l ineup you know. So open your eyes wide
and take a good long look. Th is is the best part! I hope you 'll appreciate h ow
hard I 've tried to make th is enterta ining for you . "
Wh istl ing h i s tu n e , he took o u t t h e next c a t . S u nk i n h i s chair, Nakata
opened his eyes and looked at the next victi m . His mind was a complete
blank, and he couldn't even stand up.
" I believe you already know each other," Johnnie Walker said, "but I ' l l do
th e honors anyway. Mr. Nakata, th is is Mr. Kawamur a . Mr. Kawamur a ,
Mr. Nakata ." Johnnie Walker tipped h i s hat in a theatrical gesture , greeti n g
fi rst Nakata, t h e n the paralyzed cat.
"Now that you 've said hello, I'm afra id we move right i n to farewe l l s .
H e l l o , good-bye . Like flowers scattered in a storm , man's l i fe is one l o n g

farewe l l , as they say." He gave Kawamura's soft stomach a gentle caress.
"Now's the time to stop me i f you 're going to, Mr. Nakata. Ti m e 's ticking
away, and I won't hes itate . I n the dictionary of the i n famous cat-k i l l e r Johnnie
Walker, hesitate is one word you won't fi n d ."
And indeed without any hesitation at all he slit open Kawamura's belly.
Th is time the scream was audible. Maybe the cat's tongue hadn't been fully
paralyzed, or perhaps it was a special kind of scream that only Nakata could
hear. An awfu l , bloodc urdl ing scream . Nakata closed h i s eyes and held his
trembl ing head i n h i s hands.
"You have to look ! " Johnnie Walker commanded. "That's another one of
our rul e s . C l o s i n g you r eyes isn't going to change anyth i n g . N oth i ng's goi ng
to disappear j ust because you can't see what's going o n . I n fact, th ings will be
even worse the n ext time you open your eyes. That's the kind of world we l ive
i n , Mr. Nakata . Keep your eyes wide ope n . Only a coward closes his eye s .
C l osing y o u r eyes and plugging up y o u r e a r s w o n ' t make time stand sti l l . "
Nakata did as he w a s told and opened h i s eyes.
Once h e was sure they were open, Johnnie Walker made a show of
devouring Kawa mura's heart, taking more time than before to savor it. " I t's
soft and warm . Just l ike fresh eel l iver," Johnnie Walker c o m m e nted . He the n
l i fted a bloody i n d e x fi nger t o h i s mouth and sucked it. " O n c e you 've
acqui red a taste for th i s , you get hooked. Especially the sticky blood."
H e wiped the blood off the scalpel , whistl i n g cheerily as always, and
sawed off Kawamura's head. The fine teeth of the blade cut through the bone
and blood spu rted out everywh ere .
" Please, M r. Walker, Nakata can't stand it anymore ! "
Johnnie Walker stopped wh istl ing. H e halted h i s work and sc ratched a n
earlobe. "That w o n ' t fly, Mr. Nakata . I ' m sorry y o u feel bad, I r e a l l y a m , but I
can't j ust say, Okay, will do, and call th is off. I told you . Th is is war. I t's hard
to stop a war once it starts . Once the sword is drawn, blood's goi ng to be
spilled. Th is doesn't have a nyth ing to do with theory or logi c , or even my ego .
It's j ust a ru l e , pure and simple. If you don't want any more cats to be k i l l e d ,
you 've g o t t o k i l l m e . S t a n d up, focus y o u r hatred, and strike m e down . And
you 've got to do it now. Do that and i t's all over. End of story."
Johnnie Walker started wh istl ing aga i n . H e finished c u tting off Kawa­
mura's head and tossed the headless body i n to the garbage bag. N ow there
were three heads l i ned up on the metal tray. They'd suffered such agony, yet
their faces were as stra ngely vacant as those of the cats l i n e d up in the freezer.
" Next comes the S iamese." Johnnie Walker said th i s and then extracted
a l imp S iamese fro m his bag - wh i c h of course tu rned out to be M i m i .

" S o n ow we come to l i ttle ' M i Ch iamano M i m i .' The Puccini opera . Th i s
l i ttle cat really d o e s have that elegant coquetry, doesn't she? I ' m a b i g Puccini
fan , myself. Puccini's mus i c is kind of- what should I call it? - eternally
antagonistic to the times. Mere popular enterta inment, you might a rgu e , but
it never gets old. Quite an artistic accompl ishment."
H e whistled a bar from "Mi Ch iamano M i m i ."
" B u t I have to tell you , Mr. Nakata, it took some doing to catch M i m i .
S h e 's c leve r a n d cautious, very qu ick on the draw. N o t the type t o get suck­
ered into anyth i ng. One tough customer. But the cat that can elude J o h n n i e
Walker, t h e matchless cat-killer, has yet t o be born . Not t h a t I ' m bragging or
anyth ing, I ' m j ust trying to convey how hard it was to nab her. . . . At any rate ,

voila ! You r friend M i m i ! S iamese are my absolute favorites . You 're not aware
of th i s , but a S iamese cat's heart is a real gem . Sort of l ike truffles. It's okay,
M i m i . N ever fear - Johnnie Walker's here ! Ready to e n j oy your warm, cute
l i ttle heart. Ah - you 're trembl i ng ! "
"John nie Walker." From deep inside h i mself Nakata managed t o force
out the words i n a low voice. "Please, stop it. I f you don 't, Nakata's going to go
crazy. I don't feel l ike myself anymore ."
Johnnie Walker l a i d Mimi down on the desk and as always let his fi n gers
slowly c rawl along her belly. "So you 're no longer your s e l f," h e said carefully
and qui etly. "That's very important, Mr. Nakata . A person not being h i mself
anymore ." H e picked up a scapel he hadn't used yet and tested i ts sharpness
with th e tip of his finger. Th en, as if doing a trial cut, h e ran the blade along
th e back of h i s hand. A moment later blood oozed up, dripping onto th e
desk and M i m i 's body. Johnnie Walker chuckled. "A person's not being h i m­
self anymore," he repeated. "You 're no longer yourself. That's the ticket,
Mr. Nakata . Wonderfu l ! The most i mportant th ing of a l l . 0, full of scorpions

is my mind! Macbeth aga i n ."
Without a word , Nakata stood up. No o n e , not even Nakata h i mself,
could stop h i m . With long strides he walked over to the desk and grabbed
what l ooked l ike a steak knife . Grasping the woode n handle fi rmly, he
plunged the blade i nto Johnnie Walker's stomach, p i e rcing th e black vest,
the n stabbed aga i n i n a nother spot. He could hear someth ing, a loud sound,
and at fi rst didn't know what it was . But th en he understood . Johnnie Walker
was laugh ing. Stabbed in the stomach and chest, h i s blood spouting out, he
continued to laugh .
"That's the stuff! " he yel led. "You didn't hesitate . Wel l done ! " Laugh i n g
l ike it was the fu nni est j oke he'd ever heard. Soon though , h i s l aughter turn e d
into a sob . Th e blood gurgl ing in h i s throat sounded l ike a d ra i n c o m i n g

'36

unplugged. A terrible convulsion wracked his body, and blood gushed out of
his mouth along with dark, slimy lumps - the hearts of the cats he'd eaten.
The blood spewed over the desk, onto Nakata's golf shirt. Both men were
drenched in blood. Mimi, too, lying on the desk, was soaked with it.
Johnnie Walker collapsed at Nakata's feet. He was on his side, curled up
like a child on a cold night, and was unmistakably dead. His left hand was
pressed against his throat, his right thrust straight out as though reaching for
something. The convulsions had ceased and, of course, the laughter. A faint
sneer still showed on his lips. Blood puddled on the wooden floor, and the
silk hat had rolled off into a corner. The hair on the back of Johnnie Walker's
head was thin, the skin visible beneath. Without the hat he looked much
older and more feeble.
Nakata dropped the knife and it clattered on the floor as loudly as the
gear of some large machine clanking away in the distance. Nakata stood next
to the body for a long time. Everything in the room had come to a standstill.
Only the blood continued, silently, to flow, the puddle slowly spreading
across the floor.
Finally, Nakata pulled himself together and gathered Mimi up from the
desk. Warm and limp in his hands, she was covered in blood but apparently
unharmed. Mimi looked up as if trying to tell him something, but the drug
kept her mouth from moving.
Nakata then found Coma inside the case and lifted her out. He'd only
seen photos of her, but felt a wave of nostalgia like he was meeting a long-lost
friend. " Coma . . . , " he murmured. Holding the two cats, Nakata sat down
on the sofa. " Let's go home, " he told them, but he couldn't stand up.
The black dog had appeared from somewhere and sat down next to his
dead master. He might have lapped at the pool of blood, but Nakata couldn't
remember for sure. His head felt heavy and dim, and he took a deep breath
and closed his eyes. His mind began to fade and, before he knew it, sank
down into the darkness.

Chapter 17

I

t's my third night in the cabin. With each passing day I've gotten more
used to the silence and how incredibly dark it is. The night doesn't scare
me anymore-or at least not as much. I fill the stove with firewood, settle

down in front of it, and read. When I get tired, I just space out and stare at the
flames. I never grow tired of looking at them. They come in all shapes and
colors, and move around like living things-they are born, connect up, part
company, and die.
When it's not cloudy I go outside and gaze up at the sky. The stars don't
seem as intimidating as before, and I'm starting to feel closer to them. Each
one gives out its own special light. I identify certain stars and watch how they
twinkle in the night. Every once in a while they blaze more brightly for a
moment. The moon hangs there, pale and bright, and if I look closely it's like
I can make out individual crags on the surface. I don't form any coherent
thoughts, just gaze, enthralled, at the sky.
Having no music doesn't bother me as much as I thought it would.
There're lots of other sounds that take its place-the chirping of birds, the
cries of all sorts of insects, the gurgle of the brook, the rustling of leaves. Rain
falls, something scrambles across the cabin roof, and sometimes I hear inde­
scribable sounds I can't explain. I never knew the world was full of so many
beautiful, natural sounds. I've ignored them my entire life, but not now. I sit
on the porch for hours with my eyes closed, trying to be inconspicuous, pick­
ing up each and every sound around me.
The woods don't scare me as much as they used to, either, and I've
started to feel a kind of closeness and respect. That said, I don't venture too
far from the cabin, and stay on the path. As long as I follow these rules, it
shouldn't get too precarious. That's the important thing-follow the rules
and the woods will wordlessly accept me, sharing some of their peace and
beauty. Cross the line, though, and beasts of silence lay in wait to maul me
with razor-sharp claws.

138

I often lie down in the round little clearing and let the sunlight wash over
me. Eyes closed tight, I give myself up to it,ears tuned to the wind whipping
through the treetops. Wrapped in the deep fragrance of the forest, I listen to
the flapping of birds' wings,to the stirring of the ferns. I'm freed from gravity
and float up-just a little - from the ground and drift in the air. Of course
I can't stay there forever. It's just a momentary sensation-open my eyes and
it's gone. Still,it's an overwhelming experience. Being able to float in the air.
It rains hard a couple times,but doesn't last,and each time I run outside,
naked, to wash myself. Sometimes I get all sweaty exercising, rip off my
clothes, and sunbathe on the porch. I drink a lot of tea, and concentrate on
reading,sitting on the porch or by the stove. Books on history,science, folk­
lore, mythology,sociology,psychology,Shakespeare,you name it. Instead of
racing straight through, I reread parts I think are most important till I under­
stand them, to get something tangible out of them. All sorts of knowledge
seeps,bit by bit,into my brain. I imagine how great it'd be to stay here as long
as I wanted. There are lots of books on the shelf I'd like to read,still plenty of
food. But I know I'm just passing through and will have to leave before long.
This place is too calm, too natural-too complete. I don't deserve it. At least
not yet.

On the fourth day Oshima shows up late in the morning. I'm stark naked,
sprawled on the chair on the porch,dozing in the sun, and don't hear him
approach. I don't hear the sound of his car. Shouldering a backpack, he's
walked here up the road. He quietly steps up on the porch, sticks out his
hand, and lightly brushes my head. Startled, I leap to my feet and scramble
around for a towel. There isn't one handy.
"Don't sweat it," Oshima says. "When I stayed here I used to sunbathe
nude all the time. It feels great,having the sun on places it never reaches. "
Naked like this in front of him, I feel totally defenseless and vulner­
able, my pubic hair, penis, balls all exposed. I have no idea what to do. It's a
little too late to cover up. " Hey," I say, straining to sound casual. "So you
walked up?"
" It's such a nice day I decided to," he says. " I left my car down by the
gate. " He takes a towel draped over the railing and hands it to me. I wrap it
around my waist and can finally relax.
Singing a song in a low voice he boils water, then takes out flour, eggs,
and milk from his pack and whips up some pancakes in the frying pan. Tops
these with butter and syrup. He then takes out lettuce, tomatoes, and an

onion. He's very careful with the kitchen knife as he chops up everything for
a salad. We have all this for lunch.
"So how were your three days here?" he asks, cutting a piece of pancake.
I tell him what a wonderful time I had. I omit the part about going into
the woods. Somehow, it's better not to talk about it.
'Tm glad, " Oshima says. "I was hoping you'd like it here. "
"But we're going back to the city now, aren't we?"
"That's right. It's time to go back. "
Getting ready to leave, we briskly straighten up the cabin. Wash the
dishes and put them away in the shelves, clean up the stove. Empty the water
pail, shut the valve in the propane tank. Store the food that will last in the
cupboard, throw the rest away. Sweep the floor, wipe off the tops of the tables
and chairs. Dig a hole outside to bury the garbage.
As Oshima locks up the cabin, I turn to look one last time. Up till a
minute ago it felt so real, but now it seems imaginary. Just a few steps is all it
takes for everything associated with it to lose all sense of reality. And me-the
person who was there until a moment ago-now I seem imaginary too. It
takes thirty minutes to walk to where Oshima parked the car, and we hardly
exchange a word as we go down the mountain road. Oshima's humming
some melody. I let my mind wander.
At the bottom, the little green sports car blends into the background of
the forest. Oshima closes the gate to discourage trespassers, wraps the chain
around it twice, and locks the padlock. Like before, I secure my backpack to
the rack on the back of the car. The top's down.
" Back to the city, " Oshima says.
I nod.
'Tm sure you enjoyed living all alone with nature like that, but it's not
easy to live there for a long time, " Oshima says. He puts on sunglasses and
fastens his seatbelt.
I sit down beside him and snap on my seatbelt.
" In theory it's not impossible to live like that, and of course there are
people who do. But nature is actually kind of unnatural, in a way. And relax­
ation can actually be threatening. It takes experience and preparation to
really live with those contradictions. So we're going back to the city for the
time being. Back to civilization. "
Oshima steps on the gas and we start down the mountain road. This time
he's in no hurry and drives at a leisurely pace, enjoying the scenery and the
rush of wind that whips through his bangs. The unpaved road ends and we
start down the narrow paved road, passing villages and fields.

"Speaking of contradictions, " Oshima suddenly says, " when I first met
you I felt a kind of contradiction in you. You're seeking something, but at the
same time running away for all you're worth. "
"What is it I'm seeking?"
Oshima shakes his head. He glances in the rearview mirror and frowns.
" I have no idea. I'm just saying I got that impression. "
I don't reply.
" From my own experience, when someone is trying very hard to get
something, they don't. And when they're running away from something
as hard as they can, it usually catches up with them. I'm generalizing, of
course. "
" If you generalize about me, then, what's in my future? If I'm seeking
and running at the same time. "
"That's a tough one, " Oshima says, and smiles. A moment passes before
he goes on. " If I had to say anything it'd be this: Whatever it is you're seeking
won't come in the form you're expecting. "
"Kind of an ominous prophecy. "
" Like Cassandra. "
"Cassandra?" I ask.
"The Greek tragedy. Cassandra was the princess of Troy who prophesied.
She was a temple priestess, and Apollo gave her the power to predict fate. In
return he tried to force her to sleep with him, but she refused and he put a
curse on her. Greek gods are more mythological than religious figures. By
that I mean they have the same character flaws humans do. They fly off the
handle, get horny, jealous, forgetful. You name it. "
He takes a small box of lemon drops out of the glove compartment and
pops one in his mouth. He motions for me to take one, and I do.
"What kind of curse was it?"
"The curse on Cassandra?"
I nod.
"The curse Apollo laid on her was that all her prophecies would be true,
but nobody would ever believe them. On top of that, her prophecies would
all be unlucky ones-predictions of betrayals, accidents, deaths, the country
falling into ruin. That sort of thing. People not only didn't believe her, they
began to despise her. If you haven't read them yet, I really recommend the
plays by Euripides or Aeschylus. They show a lot of the essential problems we
struggle with even today. In

koras."

"Koras? What's that?"
"That's what they called the chorus they used in Greek plays. It stands at

'4'

the back of the stage and explains in unison the situation or what the char­
acters are feeling deep down inside. Sometimes they even try to influence
the characters. It's a very convenient device. Sometimes I wish I had my own
chorus standing behind me. "
"Are you able to prophesy?"
"No such luck. " He smiles. "For better or for worse, I don't have that kind
of power. If I sound like I'm always predicting ominous things, it's because
I'm a pragmatist. I use deductive reasoning to generalize, and I suppose this
sometimes winds up sounding like unlucky prophecies. You know why?
Because reality's just the accumulation of ominous prophecies come to life.
All you have to do is open a newspaper on any given day and weigh the good
news versus the bad news, and you'll see what I mean. "
Oshima carefully downshifts at each curve, the kind of practiced gear
shifting you hardly notice. Only the change in the sound of the engine gives
it away.
"There is one piece of good news, though, " he says. "We've decided to
take you in. You'll be a staff member of the Komura Memorial Library.
Which I think you're qualified for. "
Instinctively I glance at him. "You mean I'm going to be working at the
library?"
"More precisely, from now on you'll be a part of the library. You're going
to be staying in the library, living there. You'll open the doors when it's time
for the library to open, shut them when it's time to close up. As I said before,
you seem to be a pretty self-disciplined sort of person, and fairly strong, so I
don't imagine the job will be very hard for you. Miss Saeki and I aren't all that
strong physically, so it'll really help us out a lot. Other than that, you'll just
help with small day-to-day things. Nothing to speak of, really. Making deli­
cious coffee for me, going out shopping for us. We've prepared a room that's
attached to the library for you to stay in. It's originally a guest room, but we
don't have any guests staying over so it hasn't been used for a long time.
That's where you'll live. It has its own shower, too. The best thing is you'll be
in the library so you can read whatever you like. "
"But why-" I begin to say, but can't finish.
"Why are we doing this? It's all based on a very simple principle. I under­
stand you, and Miss Saeki understands me. I accept you, and she accepts me.
So even if you're some unknown fifteen-year-old runaway, that's not a prob­
lem. So, what do you think?"
I give it some thought. "All I was looking for was a roof over my head.
That's all that matters right now. I don't really know what it means to become

part of the library, but if it means I can live there,

I'm grateful.At least I won't

have to commute anymore."
"Then it's settled, " Oshima says. " Let's go to the library. So you can
become a

part of it."

We get on the highway and pass a number of towns, a giant billboard for a loan
company, a gas station with gaudy decorations, a glass-enclosed restaurant, a
love hotel made up to look like a European castle, an abandoned video store
with only its sign left, a pachinko place with an enormous parking lot, a
McDonald's, 7-Eleven, Yoshinoya, Denny's.... Noisy reality starts to sur­
round us.The hiss of eighteen-wheelers' air brakes, horns, and exhaust.Every­
thing near me until now - the fire in the stove, the twinkle of the stars, the
stillness of the forest - has faded away.I find it hard to even imagine them.
"There are a couple of things you should know about Miss Saeki, "
Oshima says. "When she was little, my mother and Miss Saeki were class­
mates and very close. She says that Miss Saeki was a bright little girl. She got
good grades, was good at composition, sports of all kinds, and could play the
piano well, too. She was the best at whatever she tried. And beautiful. Of
course she's still quite a stunning person."
I nod.
"When she was still in grade school she had a sweetheart.The eldest son
of the Komura family - a distant relative, actually. They were the same age
and made a handsome couple, a regular Romeo and Juliet.They lived near
each other and were never apart.And when they became adults they fell in
love.They were like one body and spirit, according to my mother."
We're waiting at a red light, and Oshima looks up at the sky. When the
signal turns green, he steps on the gas and we zoom out in front of a tanker
truck. "Do you remember what I told you in the library?About how people
are always wandering around, searching for their other half?"
"That part about male/male, female/female, and male/female?"
" Right.What Aristophanes said. How we stumble through our lives des­
perately fumbling for our other half. Miss Saeki and that young man never
had to do that. They were born with their other half right there in front of
them."
"They were lucky."
Oshima nods. "Absolutely. Up to a point."
He rubs his chin with his palm like he's checking out how well he
shaved.There's no trace of a razor-his skin is as smooth as porcelain.

"When the young man was eighteen he went to Tokyo to go to college.
He had good grades and a major he was interested in. He also wanted to see
what the big city was like. She went to a local college and majored in piano.
This is a conservative part of the country, and she came from an old­
fashioned kind of family. She was an only child, and her parents didn't want
her going off to Tokyo. So the two of them were separated for the first time in
their lives. Just like God had cut them cleanly apart with a knife.
" Of course they wrote to each other every day. ' It might be good for us to
try being apart like this,' he wrote her. Then we can really tell how much we
mean to each other.' But she didn't believe that. She knew their relationship
was real enough that they didn't need to go out of their way to test it. It was a
one-in-a-million union, fated to be, something that could never be broken
apart. She was absolutely sure of that. But

he

wasn't. Or maybe he was, but

simply didn't accept it. So he went ahead and went to Tokyo, thinking that
overcoming a few obstacles would strengthen their love for each other. Men
are like that sometimes.
"When she was nineteen Miss Saeki wrote a poem, set it to music, and
played the piano and sang it. It was a melancholy melody, innocent and
lovely. The lyrics, on the other hand, were symbolic, contemplative, hard to
figure out. The contrast gave the song a kind of spirit and immediacy. Of
course the whole song, lyrics and melody, was her way of crying out to her
boyfriend, so far away. She sang the song a few times in front of people. She
was ordinarily shy, but she loved to sing and had even been in a folk music
band in college. Someone was very impressed by the song, made a demo
tape, and sent it to a friend of his who was a director at a record company.
He loved the song and had her go to their studio in Tokyo and record it.
" It was her first time in Tokyo, and she was able to see her boyfriend.
Between recording sessions they were able to love each other, as before. My
mother said she thought they'd had a sexual relationship since they were
around fourteen. Both were rather precocious, and like many precocious
young people they found it hard to grow up. It was as if they were eternally
fourteen or fifteen. They clung to each other and could again feel the inten­
sity of their love. Neither one of them had ever been attracted to anyone else.
Even while they were apart, no one else could ever come between them.
Sorry-am I boring you with this fairy tale romance?"
I shake my head. " I have a feeling you're about to come to a turning
point. "
"You're right, " Oshima says. "That's how stories happen-with a turning
point, an unexpected twist. There's only one kind of happiness, but misfor-

tune comes in all shapes and sizes. It's like Tolstoy said. Happiness is an alle­
gory, unhappiness a

story.

Anyway, the record went on sale and was a huge

hit. It kept on selling - a million copies, two million, I'm not sure of the exact
figure. At any rate it was a record-breaking number at the time. Her photo was
on the record jacket, a picture of her seated at a grand piano in the studio,
smiling at the camera.
"She hadn't prepared any other songs, so the B side of the single was an
instrumental version of the same song. With a piano and an orchestra, she of
course playing the piano. A beautiful performance. It was around 1970. The
song was on all the radio stations at the time, my mother said. This was before
I was born, so I don't know for sure. This was her one and only song as a
professional singer. She didn't put out an LP or a follow-up single. "
" I wonder if I've heard that song. "
"Do you listen to the radio much?"
I shake my head. I hardly ever listen to the radio.
" You probably haven't heard it, then. Unless it's on some oldies station,
chances are you haven't. But it's a wonderful song. I have it on a CD and lis­
ten to it every once in a while. When Miss Saeki's not around, of course. She
hates any mention of the song. She doesn't like anyone bringing up the past. "
" What's the name of the song?"
" 'Kafka on the Shore.' '' Oshima says.
" 'Kafka on the Shore'?"
" That's correct, Kafka Tamura. The same name as you. A strange coincidence, don't you think?"
" But Kafka isn't my real name. Tamura is, though. "
" But you chose it yourself, right?"
I nod. I'd decided a long time ago that this was the right name for the
new me.
" That's the point, I'd say, " Oshima says.

Miss Saeki's boyfriend died when he was twenty, Oshima goes on. Right
when " Kafka on the Shore " was a hit. His college was on strike during the
period of student unrest and shut down. He went to bring supplies to a friend
of his who was manning the barricades, just before ten one night. The stu­
dents occupying the building mistook him for a leader of an opposing fac­
tion - he did resemble him a lot - and grabbed him, tied him to a chair, and
interrogated him as a spy. He tried to explain that they'd made a mistake, but
every time he did they smashed him with a steel pipe or baton. When he fell

to the Aoor they'd kick him with their boots. By dawn he was dead. His skull
was caved in, his ribs broken, his lungs ruptured. They tossed his corpse out
on the street like a dead dog. Two days later the college asked the national
guard to come in, and within a couple of hours the student revolt was put
down and several of them were arrested and charged with murder. The stu­
dents confessed what they'd done and were put on trial, but since it wasn't
premeditated two of them were convicted of involuntary manslaughter and
given short prison sentences. His death was totally pointless.
Miss Saeki never sang again. She locked herself in her room and
wouldn't talk to anybody, even on the phone. She didn't go to his funeral,
and dropped out of college. After a few months, people suddenly realized she
was no longer in town. Nobody knows where she went or what she did. Her
parents refused to discuss it. Maybe even they didn't know where she'd been.
She vanished into thin air. Even her best friend, Oshima's mother, didn't
have a clue. Rumors Aew that she'd been committed to a mental hospital
after a failed suicide attempt in the deep forests surrounding Mount Fuji.
Others said a friend of a friend had spotted her on the streets of Tokyo.
According to this person she was working in Tokyo as a writer or something.
Other rumors had it she was married and had a child. All of these, though,
were groundless, with nothing to back them up. Twenty years passed.
No matter where she was or what she was doing all this time, Miss Saeki
didn't hurt for money. Her royalties for "Kafka on the Shore " were deposited
in a bank account, and even after taxes still amounted to a substantial sum.
She got royalties every time the song was played on the radio or included in
an oldies compilation. So it was simple for her to live far away, out of the
limelight. Besides, her family was rich and she was their only daughter.
Suddenly, twenty-five years later, Miss Saeki reappeared in Takamatsu.
The ostensible reason was her mother's funeral. (Her father had died five
years before, but she hadn't come to the funeral. ) She held a small service for
her mother and then, after things had quieted down, sold the house she'd
been born and raised in. She moved into an apartment she'd purchased in a
quiet part of the city and seemed to settle down again. After a time she had
some talks with the Komura family. (The head of the family, after the death of
the eldest son, was his younger brother, three years younger. It was just the
two of them, and no one knows what they talked about, exactly. ) The upshot
was Miss Saeki became head of the Komura Library.
Even now she's slim and beautiful and has the same neat, smart look you
see on the record jacket of "Kafka

011

the Shore. " But there's one thing miss­

ing: that lovely, innocent smile. She still smiles from time to time, definitely

a charming smile, but it's always limited somehow, a smile that never goes
beyond the moment.A high,invisible wall surrounds her,holding people at
arm's length. Every morning she drives her gray Volkswagen Golf to the
library,and drives it back home in the evening.
Back in her hometown,she had very little to do with former friends and
relatives. If they happen to meet she makes polite conversation, but this sel­
dom goes beyond a few standard topics. If the past happens to come up­
especially if it involves her - she makes a quick, smooth segue to another
topic.She's always polite and kind, but her words lack the kind of curiosity
and excitement you'd normally expect. Her true feelings - assuming such
things exist - remain hidden away. Except for when a practical sort of deci­
sion has to be made, she never gives her personal opinion about anything.
She seldom talks about herself,instead letting others talk,nodding warmly as
she listens. But most people start to feel vaguely uneasy when talking with
her, as if they suspect they're wasting her time, trampling on her private,
graceful,dignified world.And that impression is,for the most part,correct.
So even after settling back into her hometown, she remained a cipher.
A stylish woman wrapped in refined mystery.Something about her made it
hard to approach her. Even her nominal employers,the Komura family,kept
their distance.
Eventually Oshima became her assistant and started to work in the
library.At the time Oshima wasn't working or going to school, just staying at
home reading and listening to music. Except for a few people he exchanged
e-mails with,he hardly had any friends. Because of his hemophilia, he spent
a lot of time going to see a specialist at the hospital,riding around town in his
Mazda Miata,and except for his regular appointments at the University Hos­
pital in Hiroshima and the occasional stay at the cabin in the Kochi moun­
tains,he never left town.Not to imply that he was unhappy with this life.One
day Oshima's mother happened to introduce him to Miss Saeki, who took an
instant liking to him.The feeling was mutual,and the notion of working in a
library intrigued him. Oshima soon became the only person Miss Saeki nor­
mally dealt with or spoke to.

"Sounds to me like Miss Saeki came back here in order to become head of
the library," I say.
'Td have to agree. Her mother's funeral was just the opportunity that
brought her back. Her hometown must be so full of bittersweet memories
that I imagine it was a hard decision to return."

"Why was the library so important to her?"
" Her boyfriend used to live in a building that's part of the library now. He
was the eldest Komura son,and a love of reading was in his blood, I suppose.
He liked to be alone - another family trait. So when he went into junior high
he insisted on living apart from the main house,in a separate building,and
his parents gave their okay. The whole family loved reading, so they could
understand where he was coming from. If you want to be surrounded by
books, it's fine with us - that kind of thing. So he lived in that annex, with
nobody bothering him,coming back to the main house only for meals. Miss
Saeki went to see him there almost every day. The two of them studied
together, listened to music, and talked forever. And most likely made love
there. The place was their own bit of paradise. "
Both hands resting on top of the steering wheel, Oshima looks over at
me. "That's where you'll be living now,Kafka. In that room. As I said, the
library's been renovated,but it's the very same room. "
Silence on my part.
"Miss Saeki's life basically stopped at age twenty, when her lover died.
No,maybe not age twenty,maybe much earlier. . . . I don't know the details,
but you need to be aware of this. The hands of the clock buried inside her
soul ground to a halt then. Time outside, of course, flows on as always, but
she isn't affected by it. For her,what we consider normal time is essentially
meaningless. "
"Meaningless?"
Oshima nods. "Like it doesn't exist. "
"What you're saying is Miss Saeki still lives in that frozen time?"
" Exactly. I'm not saying she's some living corpse or anything. When you
get to know her better you'll understand. "
Oshima reaches out and lays a hand on my knee in a totally natural ges­
ture. "Kafka,in everybody's life there's a point of no return. And in a very few
cases,a point where you can't go forward anymore. And when we reach that
point,all we can do is quietly accept the fact. That's how we survive. "
We're about to merge onto the main highway. Before we do, Oshima
stops the car,puts up the top,and slips a Schubert sonata into the CD player.
"There's one other thing I'd like you to be aware of," he goes on. "Miss
Saeki has a wounded heart. To some extent that's true of all of us, present
company included. But Miss Saeki has a special

individual wound that goes

beyond the usual meaning of the term. Her soul moves in mysterious ways.
I'm not saying she's dangerous-don't get me wrong. On a day-to-day level
she's definitely got her act together,probably more than anybody else I know.

She's charming, deep, intelligent. But just don't let it bother you if you notice
something odd about her sometimes. "
"Odd?" I can't help asking.
Oshima shakes his head. " I really like Miss Saeki, and respect her. I'm
sure you'll come to feel the same way. "
This doesn't really answer my question, but Oshima doesn't say any­
thing. With perfect timing he shifts gears, steps on the gas, and passes a small
van just before we enter a tunnel.

Chapter 18

N

akata found himself faceup in a clump of weeds. As he awakened he
slowly opened his eyes. It was night,but he couldn't see any stars or
the moon. Still,the sky was faintly light. He could smell the strong

scent of summer grasses and hear insects buzzing around. Somehow he was
back in the vacant lot he'd been staking out every day. Feeling something
rough and warm brush against his face, he turned and saw two cats eagerly
licking both his cheeks with their tiny tongues. It was Coma and Mimi.
Nakata slowly sat up, reached out, and petted them. "Was Nakata asleep?"
he asked.
The cats cried out like they were complaining about something, but
Nakata couldn't catch the words. He had no idea what they were trying to tell
him. They were just two cats meowing.
" I beg your pardon,but I can't understand what you're trying to say. " He
stood up and checked his body to make sure there was nothing out of the
ordinary. He felt no pain, and his arms and legs were working fine. His eyes
took some time to adjust to the darkness,but once they did he saw that there
wasn't any blood on his arms or clothes. His clothes weren't rumpled or
messed up,either,and looked the same as when he'd left his apartment. His
canvas bag was right beside him,lunch and thermos inside,and his hat was
inside his trouser pocket where it belonged. Everything was in order. Nakata
couldn't figure out what was going on.
In order to save the two cats, he'd stabbed Johnnie Walker - the cat­
killer - to death. That much he remembered all too clearly. He could still
feel the knife in his hands. It wasn't a dream-blood had spurted out of
Johnnie Walker and he'd collapsed to the floor,curled up, and died. Then
Nakata had sunk back on the couch and lost consciousness. And the next
thing he knew,here he was lying among the weeds in the vacant lot. But how
did he get back here?He didn't even know the road back. And his clothes had
no blood on them at all. Seeing Mimi and Coma beside him proved it wasn't

a dream, but for some strange reason now he couldn't understand a word
they said.
Nakata sighed. He couldn't think straight. But never mind-he'd figure
it all out later. He slung the bag over his shoulder, picked up the two cats, and
left the vacant lot. Once outside the fence, Mimi started to squirm as if she
wanted to be let down.
Nakata lowered her to the ground. "Mimi, you can go back home on
your own, I imagine. It's nearby. "
That's right, Mimi's wagging tail seemed to say.
" Nakata doesn't understand what's happened, but for some reason I can't
talk with you anymore. But I was able to find Coma, and I'd better take her
back to the KoiZllmis. Everyone's waiting for her. Thank you so much for
everything, Mimi. "
Mimi meowed, wagged her tail again, then scurried off and disappeared
around the corner. There was no blood on her, either. Nakata decided to
remember that.

The KoiZllmis were overjoyed by Coma's return. It was past ten p.m. but the
children were still up, brushing their teeth before bed. Their parents were
drinking tea and watching the news on TV, and they welcomed Nakata
warmly. The two little girls, in pajamas, jostled each other to be the first to
hug their precious pet. They quickly gave Coma some milk and cat food,
which she eagerly tucked into.
"My apologies for stopping by so late at night. It would be much better to
come earlier, but Nakata couldn't help it. "
"That's all right, " Mrs. KoiZllmi said. " Please don't worry about it. "
"Don't worry about the time, " her husband said. "That cat is like a mem­
ber of the family. I can't tell you how happy we are you could find her. How
about coming in and having a cup of tea?"
" No thank you, Nakata must be going. I just wanted to get Coma back to
you as soon as possible. "
Mrs. Koizumi went to another room and returned with Nakata's pay in
an envelope, which her husband handed to Nakata. " It's not much, but
please accept this token for all you've done. We're very grateful. "
"Thank you very much. Much obliged, " Nakata said, and bowed.
"I'm surprised, though, you could find her in the dark like this. "
"Yes, it's a long story. Nakata can't tell the whole thing. I'm not too bright,
and not so good at giving long explanations. "

"That's quite all right. We are so grateful to you, Mr. Nakata, " Mrs.
Koizumi said. '' I'm sorry it's just leftovers, but we have some grilled eggplant
and vinegared cucumbers we'd like you to take home with you. "
"I'd be happy to. Grilled eggplant and vinegared cucumbers are some of
Nakata's favorites. "
Nakata stowed the Tupperware container of food and the envelope in his
bag. He walked quickly toward the station and went to a police box near the
shopping district. A young officer was seated at a desk inside, intently working
on some paperwork. His hat was on top of the desk.
Nakata slid the glass door open. " Good evening. Sorry to bother you,"
he said.
" Good evening, " the policeman replied. He looked up from the paper­
work and gave Nakata a once-over. Basically a nice, harmless old man, was
his professional assessment, most likely stopping by to ask directions.
Standing at the entrance, Nakata removed his hat and stuffed it in his
pocket, then took a handkerchief from the other pocket and blew his nose.
He folded up the handkerchief and put it back.
" Is there something I can do for you?" the policeman asked.
"Yes, there is. Nakata just murdered somebody. "
The policeman dropped his pen on the desk and stared openmouthed at
the old man. For a moment he was speechless. What the - ?
" Here, why don't you sit down," he said dubiously, pointing to a chair
opposite him. He reached out and checked that he had his pistol, baton, and
handcuffs on him.
"Thank you, " Nakata said, and sat down. Back held straight, hands rest­
ing in his lap, he looked straight at the officer.
"So what you're saying is . . . you killed somebody?"
"Yes. Nakata killed a person with a knife. Just a little while ago, " Nakata
admitted frankly.
The young officer took out a form, glanced at the clock on the wall, and
noted down the time and the statement about a knifing. "I'll need your name
and address. "
"My name is Satom Nakata, and my address is - "
" Just a moment. What characters do you write your name with?"
" I don't know about characters. I'm sorry, but I can't write. Or read,
either. "
The officer frowned. "You're telling me you can't read at all?You can't
even write your name?"

"That's right. Until I was nine I could read and write, but then there was
an accident and after that I can't. Nakata's not too bright. "
The officer sighed and laid down his pen. " I can't fill out the form if
I don't know how your name is written. "
" I apologize. "
"Do you have any family?"
" Nakata's all alone. I have no family. And no job. I live on a sub

city from

the Governor. "
" It's pretty late, and I suggest you go on home. Go home and get a good
night's sleep, and then tomorrow if you remember something come and see
me again. We can talk then. "
The policeman was nearing the end of his shift and wanted to finish up
all his paperwork before he went off duty. He'd promised to meet a fellow offi­
cer for a drink at a nearby bar when he got off, so the last thing he wanted to
do was waste time talking to some crazy old coot.
But Nakata gave him a harsh look and shook his head. " No, sir, Nakata
wants to tell everything while he still remembers it. If I wait until tomorrow
I might forget something important. Nakata was in the empty lot in the
2-chome section. The Koizumis had asked me to find their missing cat,
Goma. Then a huge black dog suddenly appeared and took me to a house. A
big house with a big gate and a black car. I don't know the address. I've never
been to that part of town before. But I'm pretty sure it's in Nakano Ward.
Inside the house was a man named Johnnie Walker who had on a funny kind
of black hat. A very high sort of hat. Inside the refrigerator in the kitchen
there were rows of cats' heads. About twenty or so, I'd say. He collects cats,
cuts off their heads with a saw, and eats their hearts. He's collecting the cats'
souls to make a special kind of flute. And then he's going to use that flute to
collect people's souls. Right in front of Nakata, Johnnie Walker killed
Mr. Kawamura with a knife. And several other cats. He cut open their stom­
achs with a knife. He was going to kill Goma and Mimi, too. But then Nakata
used a knife to kill Johnnie Walker.
" Johnnie Walker said he wanted Nakata to kill him. But I didn't plan to
kill him. I've never killed anybody before. I just wanted to stop Johnnie
Walker from killing any more cats. But my body wouldn't listen. It did what it
wanted. I picked up one of the knives there and stabbed Johnnie Walker two
times. Johnnie Walker fell down, all covered with blood, and died. Nakata got
all bloody then, too. I sat down over on the sofa and must have fallen asleep.
When I woke up it was the middle of the night and I was back in the empty

153

lot. Mimi and Goma were beside me. That was just a little while ago. Nakata
took Goma back, got some grilled eggplant and vinegared cucumbers from
Mrs. Koizumi, and came directly here. And I thought I'd better report to the
Governor right away. Tell him what happened. "
Nakata sat up straight through this whole recitation, and when he'd fin­
ished he took a deep breath. He'd never spoken this much in one spurt in his
life. He felt completely drained. "So please report this to the Governor, "
he added.
The young policeman had listened to the entire story with a vacant look,
and didn't understand much of what the old man was getting at. Goma?

Johnnie Walker?

" I understand, " he replied. 'Til make sure the Governor

hears of this. "
" I hope he doesn't cut off my sub

city."

Looking displeased, the policeman pretended to fill out a form. " I under­
stand. I'll write it down just like that:

subsidy not be cut orf

The person in question desires that his

Is that all right then?"

" Yes, that's fine. Much obliged. Sorry to take your time. And please say
hello to the Governor for me. "
" Will do. So don't worry, and just take it easy today, okay?" the police­
man said. He couldn't help adding a personal aside: " You know, your clothes
look pretty clean for having killed someone and gotten all bloody. There's not
a spot on you. "
" Yes, you're entirely correct. To tell the truth, Nakata finds it very strange
too. It doesn't make any sense. I should be covered in blood, but when I
looked it had all disappeared. It's very strange. "
"It certainly is, " the policeman said, his voice tinged with an entire day's
worth of exhaustion.
Nakata slid the door open and was about to leave when he stopped
and turned around. " Excuse me, sir, but will you be in this area tomorrow
evening?"
" Yes, I will, " the policeman replied cautiously. 'Tm on duty here tomor­
row evening. Why do you ask?"
" Even if it's sunny, I suggest you bring an umbrella. "
The policeman nodded. He turned and looked at the clock. His col­
league should be phoning any minute now. " Okay, I'll be sure to bring one. "
' 'There will be fish falling from the sky, just like rain. A lot of fish. Mostly
sardines, I believe. With a few mackerel mixed in. "
"Sardines and mackerel, huh?" the policeman laughed. " Better turn

the umbrella upside down , th e n , and catch a few. Could vinegar some for
a meal."
"Vinegared mackerel 's one of Nakata's favorites," Nakata said with a
serious look. " B u t by that time tomorrow I believe I ' l l be gon e . "
Th e next d a y when-sure enough-sardi nes and mackerel ra i n e d down
on a section of Nakano Ward , th e young policeman tu rned wh ite as a sheet.
With no wa rning whatsoever some two th ousand sardi nes and mackerel
plunged to earth from the clouds. Most of the fish were crushed to a pulp as
they slammed i nto the ground, but a few survived and flopped around on the
road i n front of the shopping distri ct. The fish were fresh, sti l l with a smell of
the sea about th e m . The fish stru ck people, cars, and roofs , but not, appar­
ently, from a great h eight, so no serious i n j uries resulted. I t was more shock­
ing than a nyth ing else. A h uge number of fish fal l i n g l ike h a i l fro m the
sky-it was positively apocalypti c .
T h e police i nvestigated the matter b u t could come u p with no good
explanation for h ow it happened. No fish market or fishing boat reported any
large number of sardi nes and mackerel missing. No planes or h e l i copters
were flying overhead at the ti me. Neither were the re any reports of tornados.
They dismissed the possibility it was some elaborate practi cal j oke-who
would possibly do something so utterly bizarre? At the request of the p o l i c e ,
the Nakano Ward Health Office collected s o m e of t h e fish and examined
th e m , but fou n d noth i ng unusual . They were j ust ordinary sardines and
mackere l . Fresh-and good to eat, by the looks of th e m . Sti l l , the pol i c e ,
afra id these mystery fi s h might conta i n s o m e dangerous substa n c e , s e n t out a
loudspeaker truck around the neighborhood warning people not to eat any.
Th i s was the kind of story TV news shows lapped up, and crews rushed to
the scene. Reporters crowded around the shopping district and sent out their
reports on th i s curious event across the nati o n . The reporters scooped up fish
with the i r shovels to illustrate what had happened. They also i n te rviewed a
housewife who had been struck on the head by one of the fal l i n g mackere l ,
th e dorsal fi n cutti ng her cheek. ''I'm j ust glad it wasn't a tu n a ," she s a i d ,
pressing a handkerc h i e f t o her cheek. That m a d e s e n s e , but s t i l l viewers
chuckled. One of the more adventuresome reporters gril l e d some of the fish
on the spot. " D e l i cious," h e told viewers proudly. "Ve ry fres h , with j ust the
right amount of fat. Too bad I don't have any grated radish and hot rice to
round out the meal."
The pol iceman was baffled . The strange old codger-what was h i s name
aga i n ?-had predicted all th ese fish ra ining down from the sky. Sardi nes and

155

mackere l , j ust l ike he'd said . . . . But I j ust laughed it off, the pol iceman
thought, and didn't even get his name and address . Should h e tel l h i s boss
about it? H e supposed so, but then again what good would it do now? Nobody
really got h u rt, and there wasn't any proof that a crime was i nvolve d . Just a
sudden squall of fi s h , ra ining from the sky.
But who's to say my boss would even believe me? he asked h i mself. Say I
told h i m th e whole story�that the day before th is happened a weird old guy
stopped by the police box and predi cted th ere'd be a shower of fi s h . H e 'd
th ink I 've compl etely lost it. And the story would make the rounds of the
precinct, getting fishier with each retell ing, and end up as a ru nning j oke
with h i m as the butt of it.
One more th ing, the policeman thought. That old man had come to
report that h e 'd murdered somebody. To give h i mself u p , in other words. And
I never took him seriously. Didn't even note it i n the l ogbook. This was defi­
nitely against regulations, and I could be brought up on c harges. But the old
man's story was so

preposterous. No pol iceman would ever take it seriously.

It's a madhouse working the police box someti mes, with paperwork up to
here. The world's filled with people with a screw loose, and, as if by agree­
ment, at one time or another they all seem to find th eir way i nto pol ice boxes
to blab out some nonsense. If you bother yourself with every one of these
nutcases, you ' l l go nuts yourself!
But that prediction about fish ra ining from the sky, a l u natic statement i f
there ever was o n e , actually d i d happen , so maybe� j ust maybe � that
story h e told about knifing somebody to death �Johnnie Walker, as h e put
it�might actually be tru e . Assuming it was, th is was a major prob l e m , for
h e 'd turned away someone confessing to murder and didn't even write up a
report on it.
Finally a garbage truck came and cleaned up all the mounds of fish . The
young policeman directed traffi c , blocking off the entrance to the shopping
distri ct so cars couldn't come i n . Fish scales were stuck to the street i n front of
th e shops and wouldn't come off no matter how much they were hosed down .
Th e street rema ined wet for some time , causing a couple of housewives on
bicycles to slip and fal l . The place reeked of fish for days afterward, getting
the n eighborhood cats all worked up. The policeman was kept busy with the
c l eanup and didn't have time to th ink any more about the stra nge old man .
The day after it rained fish, th ough , th e pol iceman gulped in shock wh e n
t h e body of a m a n , stabbed t o death , was discovered nearby. T h e d e a d m a n
was a famous sculptor, a n d h i s body was discovered b y t h e c l e a n i n g woman
who came every oth er day. Th e body was naked, lying i n a pool of blood.

Estimated time of death was in th e evening two days previous, the murder
weapon a steak knife from the kitchen . To h i s dismay, the young policeman
fi nally believed what the old man had told him. My

God, h e th ought, what a

complete mess I 've gotten myself into! I should have called up th e preci nct
and taken the old man i n . H e confessed to murder, so I should've handed
h i m over to the h igher-ups and let

them decide if he's c razy or not. B u t I

shirked my duty. Now that it's come to th is, the young pol iceman decided,
the best th ing to do is to j ust clam up and pretend it n ever happened.

But by th i s t i m e , Nakata was no longer i n town .

Chapter 19

I

t's Monday and the l ibrary's closed. The library i s quiet enough most of
the time, but on a day l ike th is when it's closed it's l ike th e land that time
forgot. Or more l ike a place that's holding its breath , hoping time won't

stumble upon it.
Down the corridor from the reading room, past a

STAFF ONLY

sign, th ere's

a sink area where you can make coffee or tea , and th ere's a microwave ove n ,
too. Just past th is is th e door t o t h e guest room, w h i c h incl udes a barebones
bathroom and cl oset. Next to the s ingle bed is a nigh tstand outfitted with a
reading lamp and alarm clock. There's also a l i ttl e writing desk with a lamp
on it. Plus an old-fash ioned set of chairs, covered in white cloth , for receiving
guests, and a chest for clothes. On top of a small, bachelor-s ize refrigerator
are some dishes and a small shelf for stowing the m away. If you feel l ike mak­
ing a simple meal, the sink area's right outside. The bath room's outfitted with
a shower, soap and shampoo, a hair dryer, and towel s . Everyth ing you need
for a comfortable short stay. Through a west-facing wi ndow you can see th e
trees in the gard e n . It's getting close to evening, and the sinking sun gl ints
past the cedar branches.
" I've stayed here a couple of times when it was too much trouble to go
home," Osh ima says . "But nobody else lIses the room . As fa r as I know, M iss
Saeki never uses it. It's not going to put anybody out, your stayi ng here, is
what I'm trying to say."
I set my backpack on the floor and look arollnd my new lodgings.
"There's a clean set of sheets, and enough i n th e fridge to tide you over.
M i l k , some fruit, vegetables, butter, ham, cheese . . . Not enough for a de­
cent meal , but enough for a sandwich or salad at least. I f you want someth ing
more, I suggest takeout, or goi ng out to eat. For laundry you ' l l have to make
do with rinsing th i ngs out i n the bathroom, I ' m afra i d . Let's see, have I forgot­
te n anyth ing?"

"Where does M i ss Saeki usually work?"
Oshima points to the c e i l i ng. "You remember that room on the second
floor you saw on the tour? S h e 's always th ere, writing. If I have to go out for a
wh ile she sometimes comes downstairs and takes over at the counter. But
unless she's got someth ing to do on the first floor, that's where you ' l l fi n d h e r."
I nod.
' ' I ' l l be h e re tomorrow before ten to flm th rough what your j ob involve s .
U n t i l th e n , j ust relax and take it easy."
"Thanks for everyth ing," I tel l h i m .
"My pleasure ," h e repl ies.
After he leaves I u nload my backpack. Arrange my meager assortment of
c lothes i n the dresser, hang up my s h i rts and j acket, line up my n otebook and
pens on the desk, put my toi letries i n th e bath room, and finally stow the pack
itself i n the closet.
The room doesn't have any decorati ons at a l l , except for a small oil paint­
ing, a real istic portra it of a young boy by th e shore. Not bad , I decide-maybe
done by somebody famous? The boy looks about twelve or so, and h e 's wear­
ing a white sunhat and sitting on a small deck chair. H i s elbow's on one of the
arms of th e chair, his chin resti ng i n his hand. He looks a l i ttle sad, but kind
of pleased , too . A black German shepherd sits next to the boy, l ike h e 's guard­
ing h i m . In the backgrou nd is th e sea and a couple of oth e r peopl e , but
they're too fa r away to make out th eir faces. A small island's visible , and a few
fist-shaped clouds float over the water. Most definitely a summer s c e n e . I sit
down at the desk and gaze at the painting for a wh i l e . I start to feel l ike I can
hear the crash of waves, the salty smell of the sea.
The boy i n the painting might be the boy who used to l ive i n th is roo m ,
th e y o u n g man M iss Saeki l oved . T h e one w h o got caught up i n th e student
movement clashes and was pointlessly beaten to death . There's n o sayi ng for
sure, but I ' m betti ng that's who it is. The scenery looks a lot like what you see
around here, for one th ing. If th at's th e case, th en it must be fro m about forty
years ago-an eternity to som ebody l ike m e . I try i magining myself in forty
years , but it's l ike trying to pi cture what l ies beyond the u n ivers e .

T h e n ext morning Osh ima arrives and shows me w h a t I ' m supposed t o do to
get the l ibrary ready to ope n . First I have to unlock and open th e win dows to
air out the rooms, make a quick pass with th e vacuum cleaner, wipe the desk­
tops, change th e flowers in th e vases, turn on the l ights, occasionally sprinkle

159

water in the garden to keep down the dust, and, when the time comes, open
the door. At closing time it's the same procedure i n reverse-lock the win­
dows , wipe the desktops aga i n , turn off the l ights, and close the front door.
'There's not much for anybody to steal here, so maybe we don't need to
be so worried about always locking the door," Osh ima tells me. "But Miss
Saeki and I don't l ike th ings done sloppily. So we try to do th i ngs by the book.
Th is is

our house, so we treat it with respect. And I hope you 'll do the same."

I noel .
N ext h e shows me what t o do a t t h e reception desk, h o w t o help o u t
people c o m i n g t o use t h e l ibrary.
" For the time being you should j ust sit next to me and watch what I do.
It's not all that hard . If something ever comes up you can't handle , j ust go
upsta i rs and ask Miss Saeki . She'll take care of it."
Miss Saeki shows up j ust before eleve n . Her Volkswagen Golf makes a
distinctive roar as it pulls up, and I can tel l right away it's h e r. S h e parks ,
comes in through the back door, and greets the two of us. " M orning," she
says . "Good morning," we answer back. That's the extent of our conversati o n .
Miss S a e k i has on a navy blue short-sleeved dress, a cotton c o a t i n h e r anTIS , a
shoulder bag. Noth i n g you could call an accessory, and hardly a h i n t of
makeup. Still , there's something about her that's dazzl ing. She glances at m e
standing next t o O s h i m a and looks for a moment l ike she wants t o s a y some­
th ing, but doesn't. She merely beams a sl ight smile in my direction and walks
up to her office on the second floor.
"Not to worry," Oshima assu res me. "She has no problem with you r
b e i n g here. She j ust doesn't go in for a lot of small talk, that's a l l ."
At eleven Osh ima and I open up the main door, but nobody comes for a
wh i l e . Dur i n g the interval he sh ows me how to use th e computers to search
for books . They're typ ical library pes I'm already familiar with . Next he
sh ows me how to arrange all the catalog cards. Every day the l i b rary receives
copies of newly published books , and one of the other tasks is to log i n th ese
new arrivals by hand.
Around el even-th irty two women come in together, wearing ide ntical
jeans. The shorter of th e two has cropped hair l ike a swimmer, wh i l e the
taller woman wears her hair pulled back. Both of th em have on j oggi ng
shoes, one a pair of Nikes, th e other As ics. The tall one l ooks around forty or
so, with glasses and a checked shirt, the shorter woman , a decade younger, is
wearing a white blouse. Both have l i ttle daypacks on, and expressions as
gloomy as a cloudy day. Neither one says very muc h . Oshima rel i eves the m of

160

th eir packs at th e entrance, and th e women, looking displeased, extract note­
books and pens before leaving the m .
Th e w o m e n g o through t h e library, checking t h e stacks one b y one,
earnestly fl i pp i n g through th e card catalog, occasionally taking notes. They
don't read anyth ing or sit down . They act less l ike people using a l i brary than
inspectors fro m th e tax office checking a company's inventory. Osh ima and I
can't figure out who they are or what they could possibly be up to . He gives
me a significant look and sh rugs . To put it mildly, I don't h ave a good fee l i n g
about th is.
At noon, wh i l e Oshima goes out to the garden to eat h i s l u n c h , I fill i n for
h i m behind the cou nter.
" Excuse me, but I have a question ," one of the women comes ove r and
says . The tall o n e . Her tone of voice is hard and unyielding, l ike a loaf of
bread someone forgot on the back of a shelf.
"Yes, what can I do for you ? "
S h e frown s and l ooks at me l ike I ' m s o m e off-kilter pi cture fra m e . "Aren 't
you a h igh school student?"
"Yes, that's right. I ' m a trainee," I answer.
"Is there one of your superiors I could talk to ? "
I g o out t o t h e garden t o g e t Osh ima. H e slowly takes a sip of coffee t o dis­
solve the bite of food in h i s mouth , brushes the crumbs fro m h i s lap, and
comes inside.
"Yes, may I help you ? " Osh ima asks her amiably.
"Just to let you know, we 're i nvestigati ng publ ic cultural fac i l ities i n the
entire country from a woman's point of view, looking at ease of use, fa i r
access , and oth er issues," she says . "Our group is d o i n g a yearlong i nvestiga­
tion and plans to publish a public report on our findings. A large number of
women are involved i n th is pro j ect, and the two of us happen to be i n charge
of th is regi o n . "
" I f y o u don't mind," O s h i m a says , "would y o u t e l l me th e name of th is
organizati o n ? "
T h e w o m a n w h i p s o u t a business card and passes it t o h i m .
H i s expression unchanged, Oshima reads it carefu lly, places it on the
counter, th e n l ooks up with a blazing smile and gazes i ntently at th e woman .
A first-c lass smile guaranteed t o make any red-bl ooded woman blush .
Th is woma n , strangely enough, doesn't react, not even a twitch of an eye­
brow. "What we 've concluded is that, unfortunately, th is l i b ra ry has several
issues that need to be addressed."

" From th e viewpoint of women, is what you 're saying," Oshima com­
mented.
" C orrect,

from the viewpoint of women," the woman answers . S h e clears

h e r throat. "And we 'd l ike to bring th is up with your administration and hear
th eir response, so i f you don't mind?"
"We don't have someth ing as fancy as an admini strati on, but I would be
happy to l i sten to you ."
"We l l , fi rst of all you have no restroom set aside for wom e n . That's cor­
rect, isn't it?"
"Yes, that's right. Th ere's no women's restroom i n th is l ibrary. We have
one restroom for both men and women."
" Even if you are a private facility, since you 're open to the publ i c don't
you th ink- i n principle-that you should provide separate restrooms for
men and women?"
" I n pri nciple?" Oshima says .
" C orrect. S hared facil ities give rise to all sorts of harassment. According
to our survey, the maj ority of women are rel uctant to use shared bath rooms.
Th is is a clear case of neglect of your fe male patrons."
"Neglect . . . ," Oshima says , and makes a face l ike he's swallowed some­
th ing bitter by mistake . He doesn't much l ike th e sound of the word , it
would seem.
"An intentional oversight."
" I ntentional ove rsight," he repeats , and gives some thought to th is
c l u msy phrase.
"So what is your reaction to all th is?" the woman asks, barely containing
her i rritati o n .
"As y o u can see ," O s h i m a says , "we 're a very s m a l l l ibrary. A n d unfortu­
nately we don't have the space for separate restrooms. Naturally it would be
bette r to have separate facilities, but none of our patrons have ever com­
plained. For better or for worse, our library doesn't get ve ry crowded . I f you 'd
l ike to pursue th is issue of separate restrooms fur ther, I suggest you go to the
Boeing h eadquarters i n Seattle and address the issue of restrooms on 747S.
A 74is much bigger than our little l ibrary, and much more crowded. As far as
I'm aware , all restrooms on passenger jets are shared by men and wom e n . "
T h e t a l l woman frowns at him severely, her cheekbones j u tting forward
and her glasses riding up her nose. "We are not i nvestigating a i rplanes. 747S
are beside the point."
"Wouldn't restrooms in both jets and i n our library- in principle - give
rise to the same sorts of problems?"

"We are i nvestigating, one by one, publ ic fac i l ities. We 're not here to
argue over principles."
Oshima's supple smile n ever fades during th is exchange . " I s that so?
I could have sworn that principles were exactly what we were discussing."
The woman real izes she's blown it. She blushes a bit, though not
because of Oshi ma's sex appeal . She tri es a different tack. "At any rate , j u mb o
j ets a r e i rrelevant here. D o n ' t try t o confuse t h e issue."
" U n derstood. No more a i rplanes," Oshima promises. " We'll bring th i n gs
down to earth ."
The wom a n glares at him and, after taking a breath , forges on. " O n e
other i s s u e I 'd l ike t o raise is how y o u have authors here separated by sex."
"Yes, that's right. The person who was i n charge before us catal oged these
and for whatever reason divided them into male and female. We were th ink­
ing of recataloging all of th e m , but haven't been able to as of yet."
"We 're not criticizing you for th is," she says .
Oshima tilts h i s head sl ightly.
"The problem , though , is that i n all categories male authors a re l i sted
before female authors," she says . "To our way of th inking th is violates th e
pri nciple of sexual equa l i ty and is totally unfai r."
Osh ima p i cks up her business card aga i n , runs his eyes over it, the n l ays
it back down on the counter. "Ms. Saga," he begi ns, "wh e n they called the
role i n school your name would have come before Ms. Tanaka , and after
Ms. Seki n e . Did you file a complaint about that? Did you obj ect, asking the m
t o reverse the order? D o e s G g e t angry because it fol l ows F i n t h e a lphabet?
Does page 68 i n a book start a revolution j ust because it fol l ows 67? "
"That's n o t th e point," s h e says angrily. "You 're intenti onally tryi ng to
confuse the issue."
Hearing th i s , the shorte r woman , who'd been standing in front of a stack
taking notes, races over.

"Intentionally trying to confuse the issue," Osh ima repeats , l ike h e 's
underl i n i n g the woman's words.
"Are you denying it?"
"That's a red herring," Oshima repl ies.
The woman named Soga stands there, mouth slightly ajar, not saying
a word .
" I n Engl ish th ere's th is expression

red herring. Someth i n g that's very

i nteresting but leads you astray from the main top i c . I ' m afraid I haven't
looked into why th ey use that kind of expression, though ."
" H errings or mackerel or whatever, you 're dodgi ng the issue."

"Actually what I ' m doing is shifting the

analogy," Oshima says . "One of

th e most effective methods of argument, accordi ng to Aristotl e . The citizens
of ancient Athens e n j oyed using th is kind of intellectual trick very much . It's
a shame, though , that at th e time women weren't incl uded in the definition
of ' citizen . ' "
"Are you making fu n of us?"
Osh ima shakes h i s head . "Look, what I ' m trying to get across i s th is: I ' m
sure the re a r e many more effective ways o f making sure that Japanese
wome n 's rights are guaranteed than sniffing around a small library i n a l i ttle
town and compl a i n i ng about th e restrooms and the card catalog. We 're doing
our l evel best to see that th is modest l ibrary of ours helps the community.
We've assembled an outstanding collection for people who love books . And
we do our utmost to put a human face on all our deali ngs with the publ i c .
You might n o t be aware o f i t , b u t th is l ibrary's collection of poetry-related
material from the 1910S to the mid-Showa period is nationally recognized . Of
course th ere are th i ngs we could do better, and l i mits to what we can accom­
plish . But rest assured we 're doing our very best. I th ink it'd be a whole lot
better if you focus on what we do

well than what we're unable to do. Isn't that

what you call fa ir?"
The tall woman looks at the short one, who looks back up at h e r a n d
o p e n s her mouth for t h e first time . "You 've j ust been evadi n g the point,
mouth i n g empty argu ments that avoid taking responsibility," she says i n a
really h i gh-pitched voi c e . "In

reality, to use the term for th e sake of conven­

i e n c e , what you 're doing is an easygoi ng attempt at self-j ustificati o n . You are
a totally pathetic , h i storical example of th e phallocentri c , to put it m i ldly."
"A

pathetic, historical example," Oshima repeats , obvi ously i mpressed .

By h i s tone of voi ce he seems to l ike the sound of that phrase.
" I n other words you 're a typ ical sexist, patriarc h i c male," the tall one
pipes i n , unable to conceal her irritation.
"A patriarchic

male," Osh ima again repeats .

The short one ignores th is and goes o n . "You 're employing the status quo
and the cheap phall ocentric logic that supports it to reduce the entire fe male
gender to second-class citizens, to limit and deprive women of the rights
they're d u e . You 're doing th is unconsciously rath er than deliberately, but that
makes you even guiltier. You protect vested male interests and become
inured to the pa in of others, and don't even try to see what evil your b l i ndness
causes women and society. I real ize that problems with restrooms and card
catalogs are mere deta ils, but if we don't begin with the sma l l th ings we'll

n ever be able to throw off the cloak of bli ndness that covers our society. Those
are the principles by which we act."
"That's the way every sensible woman feels," the tall one adds, h e r face
express ionless.

"How could any woman of generous spirit behave otherwise, given the
torments that I face," Osh ima says .
Th e two women stand th ere as sil ent as icebergs .

"Electra, by Sophocles. A wonderful play. And by the way, the term
gender was originally used to indicate grammatical gender. My fee l i n g is the
word 'sex' is more acc urate i n terms of indicating physical sexual differe n c e .
U s i n g 'gender' h e re is i ncorrect. To p u t a l i nguistic fine p o i n t on i t . "
A frozen s i l e n c e follows .
"At any rate, what you 've been saying is fundamentally wrong," Oshima
says , calmly yet emphatically. " I am most definitely not a patheti c , h i storical
example of a patriarc h i c male."
"Th e n expl a i n , s i mply, what's wrong with what we've said," the sh orter
woman says defiantly.
"Without s idestepp ing the issue or trying to show off h ow e ru dite you
are ," the tall one adds.
"All right. I'll do j ust that-expla i n it s i mply and honestly, minus any
sidestepping or displays of brilliance," Osh ima says .
"We 're waiting," the tall one says , and the short one gives a compact nod
to show she agrees.
" F i rst of all, I ' m not a male," Osh ima announces.
A d u mbfounded silence follows on th e part of everybody. I gulp and
shoot Oshima a glance.
''I'm a woman ," h e says .
'Td appreciate it if you wouldn't j oke around," the short woman says,
after a pause for breath . Not much confidence , though . It's more l ike she fel t
somebody had t o s a y something.
Oshima pulls h i s wallet out of h i s chinos, takes out the driver's l i c e n s e ,
and passes it t o t h e woma n . She reads what's written th ere, frowns, and h a n d s
it t o her t a l l c o m p a n i o n , w h o reads it and, after a moment's h esitati o n , gives
it back to Osh i m a , a sour look on her fac e .
" D i d y o u w a n t t o see it too? " O s h i m a asks me. Wh en I shake my head, h e
s l i p s t h e l icense back i n h i s wallet and puts the wallet i n h i s pants pocket. H e
then places both hands on the counter a n d says , "As you c a n s e e , b i ologically
and l egally I a m undeniably female. Wh ich is why \vhat you 've been saying

about me is

fundamentally wrong. It's s i mply impossible for me to be, as you
put it, a typical sexist, patriarchic male."
"Ye s , but - " th e t a l l woman says but then stops. The short one, l ips tight,
is playing with her collar.
"My body is physically female, but my mind's compl etely male," Osh i m a

goes o n . "Emotionally I l ive as a man. So I suppose y o u r notion of being a

historical example may be correct. And maybe I am sexist - who knows . B u t
I ' m n o t a lesbian, even though I dress th is way. M y sexual preference is for
m e n . In other words, I'm a fe male but I ' m gay. I do anal sex, and have never
used my vagi na for sex. My clitoris is sensitive but my breasts aren't. I
don't have a period . So, what am I discriminating aga i n st? Could somebody
tell m e ? "
The three of us l i stening a r e flabbergasted and don't s a y a word . One of
the women clears her throat, and the j arring sound reverberates through th e
roo m . The clock on the wall loudly ticks away the seconds.
''I'm very sorry," Oshima says , "but I ' m in the middle of lunch. I ' m hav­
ing a tuna-spinach wrap and had eaten half of it when you asked me over. If I
l eave it much longer the neighborhood cats will make a grab for it. People
th row away kittens they don't want in th e woods near the sea, so th is neighbor­
hood is full of cats . If you don't mind I 'd l ike to get back to my l u n c h . S o
excuse m e , b u t please take your t i m e a n d e n j oy t h e l ibrary. Our l i b rary i s
o p e n t o everyon e . A s l o n g as y o u follow t h e r u l e s and d o n ' t both e r the oth e r
patrons, feel free t o do whatever you'd l i k e . You can l o o k at whatever you
want. Go ahead and write whatever you l ike i n your report. We won't m i n d .
We d o n ' t receive a n y funding from anywhere and pretty m u c h do th i ngs our
own way. And that's th e way we l ike it."
After Oshima l eaves th e two women share a look, th en they both stare at
me. Maybe they figure me for Osh ima's lover or someth ing. I don't say a word
and start arranging catalog cards . The two of th e m whisper to each other i n
t h e stacks, and before l o n g they gather their belongi ngs and start t o pull up
stakes. Frozen looks on their faces, they don't say a word of thanks when
I hand back their daypacks .
After a while Oshima finishes h i s lunch and comes back i n s i d e . H e
h a n d s me two spinach wraps made of tuna a n d vegetables wrapped i n a kind
of green torti lla with a white cream sauce on top . I have these for lunch. I boil
up some water and have a cup of Earl Grey to wash it down .
" Everyth ing I said a wh ile ago is true ," Osh ima tells me when I c o m e
b a c k from l u n c h .
" S o that's w h a t y o u m e a n t w h e n you told me y o u were a s p e c i a l perso n ? "

"I wasn't trying to brag or anyth i ng," he says , "but you understand that
I wasn't exaggerating, right? "
I nod s i l ently.
Oshima smiles. " I n terms of sex I'm most definitely fem a l e , though my
breasts haven't developed much and I 've never had a period . But I don't have
a penis or testi cles or facial hair. I n short, I have

nothing. A n i c e no-extra­

baggage kind of fee l i ng, if you want to put a positive spin on it. Though I
doubt you can understand how that feels."
" I guess n ot," I say.
" Sometimes I don't understand it myself. Like, what th e heck am I, a nyway? Real ly, what

am I ? "

I shake my h ead . "We l l , I don't know what I a m , eith e r."
"A classic identity crisis."
I nod.
" B u t at least you know where to begi n . Unl ike me."
" I don't care what you are. Whatever you are , I l ike you," I tell him. I 've
n ever said th i s to anybody in my whole l i fe , and th e words make me blush .
"I appreciate it," Oshima says , and lays a gentle hand on my shoulder. " I
know I ' m a

little different from everyone else, b u t I ' m still a h u m a n being.

That's what I 'd l ike you to realize. I ' m j ust a regular person, not some mon­
ster. I feel th e same th ings everyone else does, act the same way. Sometimes,
th ough , th at small difference feels l ike an abyss. But I guess there's not much
I can do about it." H e pi cks up a long, sharpened pencil from th e cou nter and
gazes at it l ike it's an extension of h i mself. " I wanted to tel l you all th is as soon
as I could, directly, rath er than have you hear it from someone else . So I guess
today was a good opportunity. It wasn't such a pleasant expe rience , th ough ,
was it?"
I nod.
'Tve experienced all kinds of discrimination ," Oshima says . "Only
people who 've been discrimi nated against can really know h ow much it
h u rts . Each person feels the pain i n h i s own way, each has h i s own scars. So I
th ink I ' m as concerned about fa irness and j ustice as anybody. B u t what dis­
gusts me even more are people who have no imaginati o n . The kind T. S .
Eliot calls

hollow men. People who fi l l u p that lack o f i magination with heart­

less bits of straw, not even awa re of what they're doing. Callous people who
th row a lot of empty words at you , trying to force you to d o what you don't
want to . Like that lovely pair we j ust met." H e sighs and twi rls the long slen­
der pencil in his hand. "Gays , lesbians, stra ights, fe minists , fascist pigs, com­
munists, Hare Krishnas - none of th em both er m e . I don't care what banner

they ra i se . But what I

can't st and are hollow people . When I 'm with them I

j ust can't bear it, and wind up saying thi ngs I shouldn't . With those wome n­
I should 've jLlSt let it s l i de, or else called Miss Saeki and let her handle it. S he
would have given them a smile and smoothed t h i ngs over. B ut I j u st can't do
that . I say th ings I shouldn't, do thi ngs I shouldn't do. I can't control myself.
That 's one of my weak points . Do you know why that's a weak point of m i ne ? "
" 'Cause if y o u take every si ngle person w h o lacks m u c h i magination ser i­
ously, there 's no end to it," I say.
"That's it," Osh i ma says . He taps his temple l i ghtly with the eraser end of
the pen c i l . " B ut there 's one thing I wa nt you to remember, Kafka . Those are
exactly the kind of people who murdered Miss Saeki 's ch ildhood sweetheart .
Narrow minds devoid of i magination. Intolerance, theor ies cut off fro m
real ity, empty termi nology, usurped ideals, i n flex ible systems.

Those are the

t h i ngs that really fr ighte n me . What I absolutely fear and loathe . Of course it's
i mport ant to know what's right and what's wrong. I ndividual errors in j udg­
ment can usually be corrected. As long as YOll have the courage to admit mis­
takes, t h i ngs can be turned around. But intolerant, narrow minds with no
i magination are l i ke paras ites that transform the host, change form, and con­
t i nue to thrive . They're a lost cause, and I don't want anyone l i ke that coming
in

here."
Oshima points at the st acks with the tip of h i s pen c i l . What he means, of

course, is the entire l i brary.
"I wish I could j ust la ugh off people like that, but I can't."

Chapter 20

I

t was already past eight p . m . when the eighteen-wheeler refrigerated
truck pulled off the Tomei H i ghway and let Nakata out in the parki n g lot
of the F u j igawa rest area. Ca nvas bag and u mbrella in h a n d, he clam­

bered down fro m the passenger seat to the asphalt .
" G o o d luck in fi n d i n g another ride," the dr iver said, h is h e a d sticking out
the window. " I f you ask around, I'm sure you 'll find somet h i ng."
"Much obl ige d . Nakata appreciates all your help."
"Take it easy," the dr iver said, then waved and pulled back onto the
h i ghway.

Fu-ji-ga-wa, the dr iver had said. Nakata had no idea where Fu-j i-ga-wa
was, though he did understand he'd left Tokyo and was heading west . No
need for a compass or a map to tell h i m that, he knew it i nstinctively. Now if
only a truck goi ng west would give h i m a ride .
Nakata w a s hungry and decided to have a bowl of ramen i n the rest area
rest aurant . The r i ce balls and chocolate in h is bag he wanted to save for an
emergency. Not being able to read, it took h i m a wh ile to fi gure out how to
purchase a meal . Before goi ng into the dining hall you had to buy meal ti ck­
ets fro m a vending mach ine , but h e h a d t o have somebody help h i m read the
buttons. "My eyes are bad, so I can't see too wel l," he told a middle-aged
woman, and she inserted the money for h i m, pushed the r i ght button, and
handed h i m h i s change . Experience had taught h i m it was better not to let on
that he didn't know how to read . Because when he did, people stared at h i m
l ike h e was some k i n d of monster.
After h i s mea l , Nakata, umbrella in hand, bag slung over h i s shoulder,
made the rounds of the trucks in the parking lot, asking for a ride . I ' m head­
ing west, he explai ned, and I wonder if you 'd be kind enough to give me a
r i de ? But the drivers all took one look at h i m and shook their heads. An el­
derly h itchhiker was pretty unusua l , and they were naturally wary of anyth ing

out of the ordinary. Our company doesn't allow us to pick up h itchhikers ,
they a l l s a i d . Sorry.

It had take n a long t i me to make it from Nakano Ward to the e ntrance to the
Tomei H ighway. He'd never been out of Nakano before, and had no idea
where the h i ghway was . He had a special pass for the city bus l i ne he could
use, but he'd never r idden by h i mself on the subway or tra i n, where you
needed to buy a t icket .
It was j ust before ten a . m . when he packed a change of clothes, a toi let
kit, and some snacks in h i s bag, carefully put the cash he'd h idden under the
tatami in a money belt for safekeeping, and then, the large umbrella in hand,
left h i s apartme nt . When he asked the city bus driver h ow he could get to the
h ighway, the man l aughed.
"Th is bus only goes to S h i n j uku Station. C ity buses don't go on the h i gh­
way. You'll have to take a highway bus."
"Where can I get a highway bus that goes on the

To-mei H i ghway?"

"Tokyo St at i o n ," the driver replied. ''Take this bus to S h i n j uku Station,
then t ake a tra i n to Tokyo Station, where you can buy a reserved-seat t i cket .
The buses there will take you to the Tomei H ighway."
Nakat a wasn't at all sure what he meant, but went ahead and took the bus
as far as S h i n j uku . B ut when he got there he was overwhel me d . The massive
st ation was jammed with people, and he had trouble moving through the
crowds . There were so many train l i nes, too, that he couldn't figure out
wh ich one went to Tokyo Station. S i nce he couldn't read the signs, he asked
a few passersby, but their explanations were too fast, too compl icated, and ful l
of place-names h e didn't recognize . I might as well b e t a l k i n g to Kawamura,
Nakat a thought to h i m self. There was always a pol i ce box to ask directions at,
but he was afraid they'd mistake h i m for a senile old person and take h i m i nto
custody, something he'd exper ienced once before . As he wandered around
near the st ation the exhaust and noise got to him and he st arted to feel sick.
Avoiding the crowded sidewalks, he found a small park set between two h igh­
r i se buildi ngs and sat down on a bench.
Nakat a was at a complete loss. He sat there, mutter ing occasionally, rub­
bing the top of h i s close-cropped head. There wasn't a cat to be seen i n the
park. There were plenty of crows, though, squawking down and rummaging
through the trash baskets. Nakata looked up at the sky a few t i mes, a n d fro m
the sun's position could guess the approximate t i me . Because of a l l the
exhaust, perhaps, the sky was covered in a strange color.

At noon, office workers from the nearby buildi ngs flooded out to eat
lunch in the park. Nakata ate the bean-jam buns he'd brought with h i m,
wash ing them down with hot tea from his thermos. Two young women sat
down together on the bench besides h i s , and he decided to talk to the m . H ow
can I get to the

To-mei H i ghway? he asked. They told h i m the same t h i n g the

city bus driver had sai d . Take the C h u o Line to Tokyo Station, the n a Tomei
H ighway bus.
" Nakata tried that but it didn't work," Nakata admitte d . 'Tve never been
out of Nakano Ward before . So I don't know how to take the tra i n . I j ust know
how to ride the city bus. I can 't read, so I can't buy a ti cket . I took the city bus
here, but don't know how to go any farther."

You can't read?! they asked, astonishe d . He seemed l i ke a harmless
e nough old man . A nice smile, dressed neatly. Carrying an u m brel la on such
a fi ne day l i ke this was a bit odd, but he didn't appear to be homeless. A pleas­
ant face, especially those br ight-looking eyes.
"You really mean to say you 've never been outs ide Nakano Ward ? " the
girl with black ha ir aske d .
"Yes. I 've tr ied not to ever g o out of it . If Nakata got lost, there 's nobody
who'd come looking for me ."
"And you can 't read," said the other girl, the one with dyed brownish hair.
"That's right. I can 't read at all . I can understan d s imple numbers, but
can 't add."
" H m m . I i magine it would be hard for you to take a tra i n ."
"Yes, it's very har d . I can 't buy a ticket ."
"If we had t i me we could take you to the station and make s ure you get
on the r ight tra i n, but we have to get back to work soon . I ' m really sorry."
"No, no need to apologize . I'll figure it out somehow."
"I've got it ! " the girl with black ha ir excla i med. " D i d n 't Togegu c h i over
in sales say he had to go to Yokohama today?"
"Yes, now that you mention it. He'd hel p out if we asked h i m . He's a l ittle
on the gloomy s i de, but not a bad guy, really," the brown-ha ired girl sai d .
" S i n ce y o u can 't read, maybe it'd be better to h itc h h i ke," the black­
ha ired girl sai d.
" H itchh ike ? "
"Ask for a ride from somebody. Mostly i t e n d s up being rides with long­
haul truckers. Regular cars don't pick up h itchh ikers much."
" Nakata's not sure what

long-haul truckers are ."

"As long as you go there it'll work out . I h itchhiked once when I was i n
college . Truck dr ivers are a l l nice guys."

" H ow far are you gomg on the Tomei H ighway?" the brown-ha ired
girl aske d .
" Nakata doesn't know," Nakata repl ied .
"You don't know?"
'TIl know when I get there . So I'll start out goi n g west on the

To-mei

H ighway. Mter that I'll think about where I 'l l go . Anyhow, I have to go west."
The two girls looked at each other , but Nakata's words were strangely per­
suas ive and they found themselves feel i ng kindly toward the old man. They
finished their l u nches , tossed their empty cans in the trash , and stood up.
"Why don't you come with us?" the black-ha ired girl said. "We'll figure
someth ing out ."
Nakata fol l owed them into a nearby building. He'd never been i n such a
large building before . The two girls had h i m s it at a bench next to the recep­
tion desk, then spoke with the receptionist and told Nakata to wait there for a
while . They disappeared into one of the elevator banks in the l obby. As
Nakata sat there , umbrella and canvas bag in hand, office workers streamed
back inside after their lunch hour. Another scene he'd never laid eyes on
before in h i s l i fe . As if by mutual consent, all the people were wel l dressed­
ties, s h i ny br iefcases, and h igh heels, everyone rush i n g off in the same direc­
t i o n . For the l i fe of h i m Nakata couldn't understand what so many people
l i ke this could possibly be up to.
Mter a t i me the two girls were back, acccompanie d by a gangly young
man wear ing a wh ite sh irt and str iped tie .
"Th is is Mr. Togegu c h i ," the brown-ha ired girl s a i d . " He's about to drive
to Yokohama. And he said he 'll take you with h i m . He 'll drop you at the
Kohoku parking l ot on the Tomei H i ghway, and hopefully you'll be able to
find another ride there . Just go around telling people you want to go west, and
when someone gives you a ride be sure to buy the m a meal when you stop
somewhere . Do you follow?"
" B ut do you have enough money for that?" the black-ha ired one aske d .
"Yes, I have enough."
" Mr. Nakat a 's a friend of ours, so be nice to him ," the brown-ha ired girl
said to Togeguch i .
" I f you 'll be n ice t o me ," the young man rep l ied ti midly.
"One of these days . . . ," the black-ha ired one s a i d .
A s they were saying good-bye , the girls said, " Here 's a l ittle going-away
present . For when you get hungry." They handed h i m some r i ce balls a n d a
bar of chocolate they'd bought at a convenience store .

" I don't know how to thank you enough for all you 've done," Nakat a said.
'TIl be prayi n g that good t h i ngs happen to you both ."
"I hope your prayers come true ," the brown-haired one said as her com­
panion giggle d .

The young m a n, Togeguch i, h a d Nakata sit in the passenger seat of the
H i-Ace van, then drove down the Metropolitan H i ghway and onto the
Tomei . The roads were backed up, so the two of them talked about all kinds
of thi ngs as they i n c hed along. Togegu c h i was bashful, and didn't say much at
first , but after he got used to having Nakat a with h i m he st arted talking, to the
point where it wound up less a conversation than a running monologue .
There were a lot of t h i ngs he wanted to talk about, and he fou n d it easy to
open up to a stranger l i ke Nakat a, whom he'd never see aga i n . He explained
that he'd broke n up with his fian cee a few months ago. S he 'd had another
boyfriend she'd been secretly seeing all the wh ile . He said he didn't get along
well with h i s bosses at work and was thinking of quitting. His parents had got­
ten divorced whe n he was in junior h i gh, and h i s mother soon got re married
to some sleazebal l . He'd lent money from his savi ngs to a fr ien d who didn't
give any indicat i o n he'd be repaying h i m anyt i me soon. And the col lege stu­
dent who l i ved in the apartment next door blasted his music so loud he
couldn't get much sleep.
Nakata l i stened diligently, chiming i n at appropriate poi nts, toss i n g i n a n
occasional o p i n i o n of h i s own . By the time their car pulled i nto t h e Kohoku
parking area Nakat a knew j u st about everything there was to know about the
young m a n . There was a lot he didn't understand, but he did see the b i g p i c­
ture of Togegu c h i 's l i fe, namely that here was a poor you n g guy who, while
trying to l i ve an upr ight l i fe, had his share of problems.
" Nakata's much obliged to you," he said. "Thank you so very much for
the ride ."
" I e n j oyed it . Thanks to you, Mr. Nakata, 1 feel completely relaxed now.
I 've never talked to anyone l i ke this before, and I ' m happy 1 could tel l you
everything. 1 hope 1 haven't bored you with all my problems."
"No, not at a l l . Nakat a 's very happy, too, to be able to talk with you . I'm
sure good t h i ngs are goi ng to happen to you, Mr. Togeguch i ."
The young man took a teleph one card from h i s wallet and handed it to
Nakat a . " Please take this card. My company makes the m . C o n s i der it a
goi ng-away present . 1 wish 1 could give you something better."

'Thank you very much," Nakat a said, and carefully tucked it i nto h i s
wallet . H e h a d no one to phone, a n d didn't know how to use t h e card anyway,
but he thought it was more pol ite to accept it . By now it was three p . m .

I t took another hour t o fi n d someone willing t o take h i m as far as F u j igawa .
The tru cker was a beefy man in his mid-fort ies, with arms l i ke l ogs and a
j utting belly, who was hauling fresh fish in a refrigerated tru ck.
" I hope you don't mind the fish smell," the dr iver s a i d .
" Fish are o n e of Nakata's favorites," Nakat a repl ied .
The driver laughe d . "You're a strange one, aren 't you ."
" People tel l me that sometimes."
" I happen to l i ke the strange ones," the driver said. " People who look
normal and l i ve a normal l i fe -they're the ones you have to watch
out for."
"Is that so?"
"Bel ieve me, that's how it goes. In my opini on, anyway."
"Nakata doesn't have many opinions. Though I do l i ke eel . "
"Well, that's an o p i n i o n . That you l i ke eel."
" Eel is an opinion?"
" S ure, sayi ng you l ike eel 's an opinion."
Thu s the two of them drove to Fuj igawa . The driver said h i s name was
Hagit a .
" S o, Mr. Nakat a, what do you t h i n k about t h e w a y t h e wor l d 's goi ng?"
he aske d .
'Tm very sorry, I ' m not bright, so I have no i dea a t all about that,"
Nakat a said.
" Having your own opinion and not being very bri ght are two different
t h i ngs ."
" B ut Mr. Hagita, not being very bright means you can't think about
things."
" B ut you did say you like eel ."
"Yes, eel is one of Nakat a 's favorites."
"That's a connecti on, see ? "
" UIl1 ."
"Do you like c h i cken and egg over rice?"
"Yes, that's one of Nakata's favor ites too."
"Well, there 's a connection there, too," Hagita said. "You b u i l d up rel a­
tionships l i ke that one after another and before you know it you have mea n-

ing. The more connections, the deeper the meaning. Doesn't matter if it's
eel, or r i ce bowls, or gr illed fish, whatever. Get it? "
"No, I sti l l don't understand. Does food make connections between
t h i ngs? "
"Not j ust foo d . Streetcars, the emperor, whatever ."
" B ut I don't r ide streetcars."
"That's fi ne . Look - what I ' m getting at is no matter who or what you 're
dealing with, people build up meaning between themselves and the t h ings
around the m . The i mport ant thing is whether this comes about naturally or
not. Being bri ght has noth ing to do with it . What matters is that you see thi ngs
with your own eyes."
"You're very br ight, Mr. Hagita."
Hagita let out a loud laugh . " It isn't a question of i ntelligence . I'm not all
that br ight, I j ust have my own way of thinki ng. That's why people get dis­
gusted with me . They accuse me of always bri nging up t h i ngs that are better
left alone. If you try to use your head to think about things, people don't want
to have anyt h i n g to do with you ."
"Nakata still doesn 't understand, but are you saying that there 's a l i n k
between liking e e l and l i k i n g c h i cken a n d egg over r i ce?"
"You could put it that way, I suppose . There 's always goi ng to be a con­
nection between you, Mr. Nakat a , and the thi ngs you deal with . Just l i ke
there 's a connection between eel and rice bowls. And as the web of these con­
nections spreads out, a relationship between you, Mr. Nakat a, and capitalists
and the proletar iat naturally develops."
" Pro-Ie-what?"
"The proletariat," Mr. Hagita said, taking h i s hands off the steer ing
wheel and making a wide gesture . To Nakata they looked as massive as base­
ball gloves. "The people who work hard, who earn their bread through the
sweat of their brow, those are the proletar iat. On the other hand you've got
your guys who s it on their duffs, not l i fting a finger, giving orders to other
people and getti n g a hundred t i mes my salary. Those are your capital ists."
" I don't know about people who are capitalists . I ' m poor, and I d o n 't
know anybody great like that. The greatest person I know is the Governor of
Tokyo . Is the Governor a capitalist?"
"Yeah, I suppose . Governors are more likely to be capitalists' lapdogs,
though ."
"The Governor i s a dog?" Nakata re me mbered the h u ge black dog who
took h i m to Johnnie Walker's house, and that ominous figure and the Gover­
nor overlapped in h i s m i n d .

"The world's swarming with those kind of dogs . Pawns of the capital ists ."

"Pawns?"
paws, with an ' n ' ."

Capitalist cats! That's a good one . A very unique opinion you

have there ."
" Mr. Hagita?"
"Yeah?"
'Tm poor and received a

sub city every month from the Governor. Was

th is the wrong th ing to do?"
" H ow much do you get every month ? "
Nakata tol d h i m the amount.
Hagita shook his head disgustedly. " Pretty damn hard to get by on so
l i ttle ."
"That's not true , because Nakata doesn't use much money. Bes i des the

sub city, 1 get money by helping people find their lost cats."
"No kidding? A professional cat-fi nder?" Hagita sa i d , impresse d . "You 're
an amazing guy, 1 have to say."
"Actually, I ' m able to talk with cats," Nakata said. "I can u n derstand what
they say. That helps me locate the missing ones."
Hagita nodded . " I wouldn 't put it past you ."
" B u t not long ago 1 found out 1 couldn't talk with cats anymore . 1 won­
der why."
"Th i ngs change every day, Mr. Nakata. With each new dawn it's not the
same world as the day before . And you're not the same person you were ,
either. You get what I ' m saying?"
"Yes."
"Connections change too. Who's the capital ist, who's the proletarian .
Wh o's on the right, who's on the left. The i n formation revol ution, stock
options, floating assets , occupational restructuring, multinational c orpora­
tions - what's good, what's bad. Boundaries between things are disappearing
all the time . Maybe that's why you can't speak to cats anymore ."
"The differen ce between right and left Nakata u n derstands. Th is is r i ght,
and th i s is left. C orrect?"
"You got it," Hagita agreed . "That's all you need to know."
The last th ing they did together was have a meal in a rest area restaurant.
Hagita ordered two orders of eel, and when Nakata insiste d on paying, to
thank h i m for the r i de , the driver shook h i s head emphatical ly.

"No way," he said. 'Td never let you use the pitt ance they give you for a
subsidy to feed me ."
" M u c h obliged, the n . Thank you for such a treat," Nakat a said, happy to
ac cept his kindness.

Nakat a spent an hour at the Fu j igawa rest area asking dr ivers for a r i de, but
couldn't fi n d anyone willing to t ake h i m . He didn't start to panic, though, or
get depresse d . I n h i s mind, t i me passed very slowly. Or barely at a l l .
H e went outside for some a ir and wandered around. T h e sky w a s cloud­
less, the surface of the moon clearly visible . Nakat a strolled aro u n d the park­
ing lot, wh ich was fi l led with countless huge trucks, like giant beasts l i ne d up
shoulder to shoulder , resting. Some of the trucks had at least twenty giant
tires, each one as tall as a man. So many trucks, all racing down the h ighway
so late at night - what could they possibly be carrying inside ? Nakat a couldn't
imagine . I f he could read the writing on the sides of the tru cks, he wondered,
would he be able to figure it out?
After about an hour he spotted ten or so motorcycles parked i n a corner
of the lot where there weren 't many cars. A clump of young men stood nearby
in a circle, looking at something and yelling. I ntr igued, Nakat a approached
them. Maybe they'd discovered something unusual?
When he got cl oser he saw that they had surrounded someone lyi ng on
the ground and were punchi ng, kicking, and generally tryi ng their best to
h urt him. Most of the men were unarmed, though one of them had a c h a i n
i n h i s hand. Another held a b l a c k stick that looked l ike a police m a n 's baton .
They wore unbuttoned short-sleeved sh irts, some in T-sh irts, others in run­
ning sh irts, most of them with hair dyed blond or brown, some with t attoos on
their arms. The young man they were beating and kicking was dressed much
the same .
A s Nakat a approached, tapping the asphalt surface with the t i p of h i s
umbrella, a couple o f the men turned around a n d glared at h i m . They
relaxed when they saw it was j u st some harmless old man. "Why don't you
beat it, Pops," one of them growled .
Unperturbed, Nakat a walked over even closer. The m a n on the ground
see med to be bleeding from h i s mout h . "Blood's coming out," Nakat a s a i d .
" He might die ."
Caught off guard, the men didn't react right away.
" Maybe we should kill you too, while we're at it," the one with the c h a i n
s a i d . " Killing one o r two - no s k i n off my nose."
177

"You can't kill someone for no reason," Nakata insisted .

"You can't kill someone for no reason," one o f them mimicke d, a n d h i s
friends laughe d .
"We got o u r reasons, pal," another m a n said. "And i t a i n ' t g o t nothin' to
do with you whether we kill h i m or not . So take your worth less umbrella a n d
h it the road, before i t starts raini ng."
The man on the ground started crawl ing forward, and a young man with
a shaved head came over and kicked h i m hard in the ribs with h i s work boots.
Nakat a closed h i s eyes. He could feel something wel l i n g up ins ide h i m,
beyond h i s contr o l . He felt slightly nauseous. The me mory of stabb i n g John­
nie Walker suddenly came back to him. His hand st i l l remembered what i t
fel t l ike t o plunge a knife i nto a man's chest .

Connections. Could th i s b e one
of those connections that Mr. Hagita was talking about? Eel knife Johnnie
Walker? The men's voices sounded distorted, and he couldn't tel l them apart

anymore . Their voices blended together with the ceaseless drone of tires from
the h i ghway to make a strange tone . H i s heart surged blood to his extremities
as night enveloped h i m .
Nakat a looked up a t the sky, then slowly opened h i s umbrella and hel d it
over h i m . Very carefully he took a few steps backward, opening a space
between h i m self and the gang. He looked around, then took a few more
steps back.
The young men laughed when they saw this. " Hey, look at the cool old
guy ! " one of them said. " He's actually using his umbre l la ! "
But they didn't laugh for long. Suddenly, unfamil iar greasy objects began
to rain down from the sky, striking the ground at their feet with a weird slap .
The young men stopped kicking their prey and l ooke d up at the sky. There
weren't any clouds, but thi ngs were defi nitely fal l ing one after another from a
spot in the sky. At first in dribs and drabs, then gradually more and more fel l,
until before they knew it they were caught in a downpour. The ob jects pelt­
ing down from the sky were l ittle black l u mps about an i n c h and a half long.
I n the l i ghts of the parking lot it looked like s l i ck black snow fal l i ng on the
men's shoulders, arms, and necks and sticking there . They desperately tr ied
to yank the objects off, but couldn't.

"Leeches!" someone yelled.
As i f given a s ignal, the men all shouted and raced across the parking l ot
to the restrooms. One of them, a young blond man, was knocked to the
ground by a car he'd run i n front of. He jumped up, slammed his fi st on the
hood of the car, and loudly cursed the driver. That was all, though, and he
soon l i mped away toward the restrooms.

The leeches ra i ned down hard for a time, then tapered off and stoppe d .
Nakata fol ded up h i s umbrella, brushed off t h e leec hes, and went over to see
how the i n j u red man was doing. A mound of the s l i my c reatures squ i rmed a l l
around, so h e couldn't get very c lose, a n d t h e m a n on t h e ground w a s buried
i n the m . Look i n g c losely, Nakat a could see that he was bleeding from c ut
eyelids, and some of h i s teeth looked broke n . Nakata knew this was too much
for h i m to handle by h i mself, so he hurr ied back to the rest a ur a nt and told
one of the employees that a man was lying i n the parking l ot, h urt . "You'd
better call the pol i ce, or else he might die," he sa i d .
Not long after this Nakat a found a truck dr iver w i l l i n g to give h i m a r i de
as far as Kobe . A sleepy-l ooking man in his mid-twenties, not very t a l l, with a
ponyt a i l, a p ierced ear, and a Chunichi Dragons baseball tea m cap, he sat
there i n the rest a urant, smoking and flipping through a comic book. A gaudy
aloha sh irt and oversize Nikes completed his wardrobe . He tapped his ciga­
rette ashes i nto the leftover broth in h i s bowl of ramen, st ared hard at Nakat a,
then gave a rel u ct a nt nod. "Yeah, okay. You can ride with me . You kind of
remind me of my grandpa. The way you look, or maybe how you t al k, kind of
off the point. . . . At the end my grandpa got senile and died. A few years ago."
He went on to explain that they should get to Kobe by morning. He was
del ivering furniture to a department store warehouse there . As he pulled h i s
truck out o ft h e parking lot, they passed a c a r accident. A couple of patrol cars
were already at the scene, red l i ghts flashi ng, and a pol i ceman with a signal
l ight was direct ing traffi c . It didn't appear to be much of a n accident. A few
cars had c o l l i ded, the side of a minivan was dented, a car's t a i l l ight broke n .
The truck driver stuck h i s head out the wi ndow a n d exchanged a few
words with a patrolman, then rolled lip his window. " He said a pile of leec hes
fel l from the sky," he said, unmoved . "They got crushed by cars, the road got
all slippery, a n d some drivers lost control. So go slow and take it easy, he told
me . On top of that some local gang of bikers beat up somebody. Leeches and
bikers - what a weird combination. Keeps the cops busy, at least."
He drove carefully toward the exit . Even goi ng slow the truck s l i pped a
couple of t i mes, and the driver straightened it out with a subtle twist of the
whee l . " Man, it really looks l ike a whole bunch fell down, and it's damn s l i p­
pery. B ut, boy - leec hes, that 's pretty gross . Ever had a leech stick to you ? "
"No, as fa r as Nakat a c a n remember, I don't t h i n k so," Nakat a responde d .
"I w a s brought up i n the mountains of Gifu, and i t happened to m e l ots
of t i mes. I 'd be walking i n the woods and they'd fal l down from the trees . Go
wading i n the streams and they'd st ick to your legs . I know a t h i n g or two
about leeches, bel ieve me . Once they get stuck on you they're hard to pull

off. If you pull off a big sucker your skin comes off and you'll have a scar. S o
t h e best thing is to burn 'em off. Awful things, the way they s u c k your blood .
And once they're filled up they get all soft and mushy. Pretty gross, h u h ? "
"Yes, i t certa inly is," Nakata agreed .
" B ut leeches aren 't supposed t o fal l down from the sky i nto some rest
area parking lot . I never heard of anyth ing so stup i d ! The guys aro u n d here
don't know the first thing about leeches. Leeches don't fal l from the sky, n ow
do they?"
Nakat a was s i lent and didn't respon d .
" A few years b a c k a huge number of millipedes appeared all a t once i n
Yamanash i Prefecture, a n d cars were slipping everywhere . Just l i ke t h i s, the
road got all slippery and there were a lot of accide nts . They got all over
the tracks and the tra ins couldn't run either. B ut eve n m i l l i pe des aren 't goi ng
to r a i n down from the sky. They crawl out from somewhere . Anybody can
see that."
"A long t i me ago I l ived in Yamanash i . During the war."
"No kidding," the dr iver said. "Which war was that ? "

Chapter 21

S C U L P T O R KO I C H I TA M U RA S TAB B E D TO D E AT H

Found i n Study, Floor a Sea of Blood
The world-renowned sculptor Koichi Tamura was found dead on the
afternoon of the 30th in the study in his home in Nogata, Nakano
Ward . The body was discovered by a female housekeeper. Mr.
Tamura was found facedown, nude, covered in blood . There were
signs of a struggle and the death is being treated as a homicide . The
weapon used was a knife from the kitchen discovered beside the body.
The pol ice estimate the t i me of death as the evening of the 28th,
and s i n ce Mr. Ta mura l ived alone the body was only discovered two
days later. Mr. T amura suffered several deep st ab wounds to the c hest
from the sharp steak knife, and it is bel ieved he died almost i n st a ntly
from massive loss of blood from i n j uries to the heart and l u ngs. Sev­
eral ribs were also broke n from what appears to be mass ive blunt
force . The police have not announced having found any fi n gerpr i nts
or anything left beh i n d at the scene . It also appears that there were
no witnesses to the cr ime .
S i nce the hOllse was undisturbed, and val uables and a wal let near
the scene were not t aken, pol ice view the cr ime as a personal
vendett a . Mr. Tamura's home is i n a qu iet residential neighborhood,
but no one heard anything at the t i me of the murder, and neighbors
were shocked at the news . Mr. Tamura had l ittle to do with h i s neigh­
bors and l i ved qu ietly, and no one not i ced anyt h i n g out of the
ordinary around the time of the incident.
Mr. Tamura l i ved with his son ( 1 5 ) , but according to the house­
keeper the son hasn't been seen in some ten days . The son has also
been absent from h i s j u n ior h igh and pol ice are tracing his where­
abouts.

In addition to h i s residence, Mr. Tamura had an office and studio
i n Musashino City, and according to h i s secretary, until the day
before the murder he was working on a new piece of sculpture as
usua l . On the day of the incident, there was a matter she had to con­
tact h i m about, but every time she phoned h i s res i dence she got h i s
message mac h ine.
Mr. Tamura was born in Kokubu n j i, Tokyo . He entered the Dept. of
Sculpture at Tokyo Arts Institute, and wh ile still a student completed
many i n novative pieces that became the talk of the art wor l d . H i s
c h ief theme was the human subconscious, a n d h i s sculptures, which
were i n a u n ique style that challenged the conventional, were inter­
nationally acclaimed . His best known work was his maj or "Labyr inth "
ser ies, wh ich explored, through an uninhib ited expression of the
imagination, the beauty and inspiration fou n d in the meandering
contours of labyrinths . He was at present a visiting professor at an art
institute, and two years ago, at the exhib ition of h i s work at the
Muse u m of Modern Art in New York . . . .

I

stop reading at th is point. There's a photo of our front gate, and one of my
father i n younger days, and they give the newspaper an ominous fee l i n g .
I fol d it twice and put it on top of the table . S t i l l sitting on the bed, I d o n ' t

say anyth ing, j ust press my fingertips agai nst my eyes. A dull sou nd, at a con­
stant frequency, pounds i n my ears. I try shaking my head to get r id of it, but
it won't go away.
I ' m in my room in the l ibrary. It's seven p . m . Osh i ma and I have j ust shut
the place up for the night, and a while ago Miss Saeki drove off i n her Volks­
wagen Golf. It's just me and Oshima in the library now. And that irritati n g
pounding i n my ears.
"Th is paper's from two days ago . The arti cle came out wh ile you were up
i n the mounta i n s . When I saw it I thought maybe th is Koi c h i Tamura might
be your father. A lot of the details fit. I should 've shown it to you yesterday,
but I wanted to wa it until you got settled i n ."
I nod, still pressing my eyes. Oshima doesn't say anyth ing more .
"I didn't kill h i m, you know."
"I know that," Osh i ma says . "On the day of the murder you were here at
the l ibrary, reading until evening. You wouldn't have had enough time to go

back to Tokyo, murder your father , and then get back to Takamatsu. It's
i mposs ible."
But I wasn't so sure. I did the math and figured out he was murdered the
same night I woke up with my shirt covered in bl ood.
" B u t the paper does say the pol ice are trying to locate you. As a n impor­
tant witness."
I nod.
" I f you go to the pol ice and prove to them you have a firm a l i b i , it'd make
th ings a lot eas ier than trying to run around avoi ding the m . Of course I ' l l
back you up."
"But i f I do that, they'll take me back to Tokyo."
"I would th ink so. I mea n , you still have to finish j u nior h igh - that's the
law. You can't j ust go anywhere you want to at your age. The l aw says you st i l l
need a guardian."
I shake my head. " I don't want to expla i n anyth ing to anybody. And I
don't want to go back home to Tokyo, or back to sch ool."
Q u iet for a ti me, Oshima looks at me intently. "That's someth ing you 'll
have to decide for yourself," he finally says i n a calm tone . " I t h i n k you have a
r ight to l ive h owever you want. Whether you 're fifteen or fi fty-one, what does
it matter? B ut unfortunately society doesn't agree. So let's say you don't
explain anyt h i n g to anybody. You ' l l be constantly on the r u n fro m the pol i ce
and society. Your l i fe will be pretty harsh . You 're only fifteen, with your whole
l i fe ahead of you. You 're okay with that?"
I don't say anyth ing.
Oshima p icks up the paper and scans the article again. "According to th is
you 're your father's only relative."
" I have a mother and an older sister," I explain, "but they left a long time
ago, and I don't know where they are. Even if I did, I seriously doubt they'd
come to the fu neral."
"Well, if you 're not there, I wonder who's going to take care of everyth ing.
The fu neral, h i s business affa irs."
"Like it said in the paper , he has a secretary at his office who's in charge
of everyt h i ng. S he knows about h i s business, so I ' m s ure she can handle it.
I don't want anyth ing of h i s handed down to me. The house, h i s estate, what­
ever - they can get rid of it however they want." The only th ing he's handed
down to me, I t h i nk, are my ge nes.
" C orrect me if I ' m wrong," Oshima says, "but you don't seem too sad
your father was murdered."

" N o , I do feel sad. H e 's my fath er, after a l l . But what I really regret is that
h e didn't die sooner. I know that's a terrible th ing to say . . . . "
Osh ima shakes h i s head. "No problem. Now more than ever you have
the right to be honest."
"We l l , I th ink . . . " My voice seems weak, lacking i n authority. Unsure of
where they're headed, my words are sucked i nto the void . Osh ima comes over
and sits down n ext to me.
"All kinds of th i ngs are happening to m e ," I begi n . " Some I chose, some
I didn 't. I don't know how to tell one from the other anymore . What I mean
is, it feels l ike everyth i ng's been decided in advance - that I ' m fol l owing a
path somebody else has al ready mapped out for m e . It doesn't matter how
much I th ink th i ngs ove r, how much effort I put i nto it. In fact, the harder I
try, the more I lose my sense of who I a m . It's l ike my identity's an orb it that
I 've strayed far away from, and that really h u rts . But more than that, it scares
me. Just th inking about it makes me fl i nch."
Osh ima reaches out to touch my shoulder. I can feel the warmth of his
hand. " For the sake of argu ment, let's say all your choices and all your effort
are destined to be a waste . You 're still very much yourself and nobody else.
And you 're forgi ng ahead, as

yourself So relax."

I ra ise my head and look at h i m . He sounds so convincing. "Why do you
th ink that?"
" Because there's i rony involved."
" I rony?"
Osh ima gazes deep into my eyes. "Listen, Kafka . What you 're experienc­
ing now is the motif of many Greek tragedies. Man doesn't choose fate . Fate
ch ooses man. That's the basic worldview of Greek drama. And the sense of
tragedy - according to Aristotl e - comes, ironically enough , not from the pro­
tagonist's weak points but from his good qualities. Do you know what I ' m get­
ting at? People are drawn deeper into tragedy not by th eir defects but by the i r

virtues. Sophocles' Oedipus Rex b e i n g a great example . Oedipus i s drawn into
tragedy not because of lazi ness or stup idity, but because of h is courage and
honesty. So an i n evitable i rony results ."
" B u t it's a hopeless s ituation."
"That depends," Oshima says . " Sometimes it is. But irony deepens a per­
son, helps them matur e . I t's the entrance to salvation on a h igher plane, to a
place where you can find a more universal kind of hope. That's why people
e n j oy reading Greek tragedies even now, why they're considered prototyp ical
classics. I ' m repeati ng myself, but eve ryth ing in l i fe is metaphor. People don't
usually kill th eir father and sleep with their mother, right? I n oth e r word s , we

accept irony through a devi ce called metaphor. And th rough that we grow
and become deeper human bei ngs ."
I don't say anyth ing. I ' m too involved i n th inking about my own situati o n .
" H ow m a n y p e o p l e know you're i n Takamatsu?" Osh ima asks .
I shake my head. "Coming here was my own idea, so I don't th ink any­
body else knows ."
"Th e n you 'd better lay low in th e l ibrary for a while. Don't go out to work
at the reception area. I don't th ink the pol ice will be able to track you down ,
but if th i ngs get sticky you can always h i de out at the cab i n . "
I l o o k at Osh i m a . " I f I hadn't m e t you , I d o n ' t th ink I would 've m a d e it.
There 's nobody else who can help me."
Oshima smiles. H e takes h i s hand away from my shoulder and stares at
his hand. "That's not tru e . If you hadn't met me, I'm sure you would 've found
another path to take . I don't know why, but I ' m certain of it. I j ust get that
feeling about you ." H e stands up and bri ngs ove r another newspaper from the
desk. "By the way, th is article was in the paper the day before th e other o n e .
I remember it b e c a u s e it w a s so unusual . Maybe it's j ust coincidence, but i t
took p l a c e near y o u r house."

Sardines and Mackerel in Nakano Ward
Shopping District

At around 6 p . m . on the evening of the 29th , residents of the
*

-chome district of Nakano Ward were startl ed when some 2,000 sar­

dines and mackerel ra ined down from the sky. Two housewives shop­
ping in th e neighborhood market received sl ight facial i n j ur i e s wh e n
struck by th e fal l i n g fish, b u t no other i n j uries were reporte d . A t the
time of the i ncident it was sunny, with no clouds or wind. Many of
the fish were sti l l al ive and j u mped about on the pave ment. . . .

I finish readi ng the article and pass the paper back to Osh i m a . The reporter
speculated about several poss ible causes of the inci dent, though none of
th em are very convi n c i ng. The police are investigati ng the poss i b i l i ty it
involved theft and someone playing a kind of practical j oke. The Weath e r
Service reported that there weren't a n y atmospheric conditions present th at
might have led to fish ra ining from the sky. And from the M i n istry of Agricul­
hue , Forestry, and Fisheries spokesma n , still no comment.

" D o you have any idea why th is happened?" Osh ima asks m e .
I shake m y h e a d . I don't have a c l u e .
"The d a y after your fath er was murdered, c l o s e t o where it happe n e d , two
th ousand sardi nes and mackerel fal l from the sky. Just coincidence?"
" I suppose so."
"The newspaper also says that at th e Fuj igawa rest area on the Tomei
H ighway, l ate at night on the very same day, a mess of leeches fel l from the
sky i n one small spot. Several fender benders resulte d , they say. Apparently
the leeches were quite large . No one can explain why leeches would ra i n
from t h e sky. It was a clear night, n o t a cloud i n t h e sky. No i d e a w h y th i s
happen e d , either?"
Aga i n I shake my head.
Oshima folds up the newspaper and says , "Wh i c h leaves us with the fac t
that strange, i nexpl icable events a r e happening one after t h e oth e r. Maybe i t's
j ust a series of coincidences, but it still bothers m e . There's someth i n g about
it I can't shake."
"Maybe it's a metaphor?" I venture.
" Maybe . . . But sardines and mackerel and leeches ra ining down fro m
t h e sky? What kind of metaphor is

that?"

In the silence I try putting into words someth ing I haven't been able to
say for a long ti m e . "You know someth ing? A few years back my fathe r had a
prophecy about me."
"A proph ecy?"
'' I 've never told anybody th is before. I figured nobody'd beli eve m e . "
Osh ima doesn't s a y a word . His s i l e n c e , though , encourages m e .
" More l ike a curse t h a n a prophecy, I guess. My father t o l d me th is over
and over. Like he was chiseling each word into my b ra i n ." I take a deep
breath and check once more what it is I have to say. Not that I really need to
check i t - it's always the re , banging about in my head, wheth e r I examine it
or not. But I have to weigh the words one more time. And th is i s what I say:

"Someday you will murder your father and be with your mother, h e said."
Once I 've spoken th is, put th is thought into concrete words, a hollow
fee l i n g grabs hold of m e . And inside that hollow, my heart pounds out a
vacant, meta l l i c rhyth m .
Express ion unchanged, Oshima gazes a t me for a long ti m e .
" S o h e s a i d that someday you wou ld kill y o u r fath er with y o u r own
hands, that YOll would sleep with your mother."
I nod a few more times.

186

"The same prophecy made about Oedipus. Though of course you
knew that."
I nod . " B u t that's not a l l . There's an extra i ngredi ent h e threw i nto the
mix. I have a s i ster six years older than me, and my father said I would sleep
with

her, too ."

"Your fath e r actually said th is to you ? "
"Yeah . I w a s s t i l l i n elementary school th en, and d i d n ' t know w h a t h e
meant b y 'be with .' I t was only a few years l ater that I caught o n . "
Oshima doesn't say anyth ing.
"My fathe r told me th ere was noth ing I could do to escape th i s fate . That
prophecy is like a timing device buried inside my genes, and noth ing can
ever change it.

I will kill my father and be with my mother and sister."

Oshima stays silent for quite some ti m e , l ike he's inspecting each word
I 'd spoken , one by one, examining them for clues to what th is i s all about.
"Why i n the world would your father tel l you such a n awful th ing?" he
finally asks .
" I have no idea. He didn't explain it beyond that," I say, shaking my head .
" Maybe he wanted revenge on h i s wife and daughter who left h i m . Wanted to
punish th e m , perhaps. Through me."
" Even if i t meant h u rting you ? "
I n o d . "To my fath er I ' m probably noth ing more than one of h i s sculp­
tures. Someth i n g he could make or break as he sees fit."
"That's a pretty twisted way of th inking," Osh ima says .
" I n our home

everything was twisted. And when everyth i n g's twiste d ,

what's n o r m a l ends up looking weird too . I 've known th is for a l o n g time, but
I was a child. Where else could I go? "
'Tve s e e n your fath er's works a number of times," Oshima repl ies. " H e 's a
wonderful sculptor. H i s pieces are original , provocative , powerfu l . Uncom­
promising, is h ow I 'd put it. Most definitely the real th ing."
"Maybe so. But the dregs left over from creating th ese h e spread every­
wh ere, l ike a poison you can't escape. My fathe r poll u ted everyth i n g h e
touched, damaged everyone around h i m . I don't know if h e d i d i t because h e
wanted to . Maybe h e

had t o . Maybe it's j ust part of h i s make u p . Anyhow, I get

the fee l i n g h e was connected to someth ing very unusua l . Do you have any
idea what I mean?"
"Yeah , I th ink so," Osh ima says . " Something beyond good and evi l . The
source of power, you might call it."
"And half my genes are made up of that. Maybe that's why my moth e r

abandoned m e . Maybe she wanted to cut herself off from me because I was
born from th is terrible sour c e . Since I was polluted."
Osh ima l i ghtly presses his fingertips agai nst h i s te mples as h e mulls th is
over. H e narrows h i s eyes and stares at me. "Is there any chance h e 's not you r
biological fath er?"
I shake my head. "A few years ago we got tested at a hospita l . The two of us
had a DNA check done on our blood. No doubt about it- b iologically we're
fathe r and son a h u ndred percent. They showed me th e results of th e tests ."
"Ve ry cautious of h i m ."
" I guess he wanted me to know I was one of the works h e 'd c reate d .
Someth ing h e 'd finished a n d signed."
Osh ima's fi ngers stay pressed to his temples. " But your father's prophecy
didn't come tru e , did it? You didn't murder him. You were here i n Takamatsu
when it happened. Somebody else killed him i n Tokyo ."
S i l e ntly I spread my hands out in front of me and stare at the m . Those
hands that, i n the darkness of night, had been covered with blood . " I ' m not so
sure of that," I tel l h i m .
A n d I proceed t o tel l him everyth ing. About h o w that night, on my way
back to th e hote l , I 'd lost consciousness for a few hours. About waki n g up i n
th e woods b e h i n d t h e shrine, m y shirt sticky with somebody's blood. About
washing the blood off i n the restroom . About how several hours had been
e rased from my memory. To save time I don't go into how I stayed overnight
at Sakura's . Oshima asks th e occasional question, and files away the deta ils i n
h i s head. But he doesn't voi ce a n y opinions.
" I have no idea how that blood got all over m e , or whose blood it could
be. It's a complete blank," I tell him. "But maybe I did kill my fath er with my
own hands, not metaphorical ly. I really get the fee l i n g that I

did. Like

you said, I was i n Takamatsu that day - I definitely didn't go to Tokyo . But

In dreams begin responsibilities, right?"
Osh ima nods. "Yeats."
" S o maybe I murdered h i m through a dream," I say. "Maybe I went
th rough some special dream circuit or someth ing and killed h i m ."
"To you that might feel l ike the truth , but nobody's going to grill you
about your poetic responsibil ities. Certa inly not th e pol i c e . Nobody can be in
two places at once. It's a scientific fact - E instein and all that - and the l aw
accepts that principle."
" B u t I ' m not talking about science or law here."
"What you 're talking about, Kafka," Oshima says , " i s j ust a theory. A bold ,
surrealistic theory, t o b e sure, but one that belongs i n a science fiction novel ."

18 8

"Of course it's j ust a theory. I know th at. I don't th ink anybody else is
going to beli eve such a stupid th ing. But my father always used to say that
without counte revidence to refute a th eory, science would never progress.
A

theory is a battlefield in your head that was h i s pet phrase. And right n ow
-

I can't th ink of any evidence to counter my hypothesis."
Osh ima is s i l e nt. And I can't th ink of anyth ing else to say.
"Anyway," Oshima finally says , "that's why you ran away to S h ikoku.
To escape your fath er's c urse ."
I nod, and point to th e folded-up newspaper. "But it l ooks l ike th ere's
no escape."

Distance won't solve anything, the boy named C row says .
"We l l , you definitely need a h iding place ," Osh ima says . " B eyond that
there's not much I can say."
I suddenly realize how exhausted I am. I lean against Osh i m a , and he
wraps h i s arms around m e .
I p u s h my face up against h i s fl a t ch est. "Osh i m a , I d o n ' t w a n t t o do those
th i ngs . I don't want to kill my fath er. Or be with my moth e r and s ister."
"Of course you don 't," h e repl ies, ru nning his finge rs through my short
hair. " H ow could you ? "
"Not even i n dreams."
"Or i n a metaphor," Osh ima adds. "Or i n an all egory, or an analogy." He
pauses and th e n says , " I f you don't mind, I ' l l stay with you h e re tonight. I can
sleep on the c h a i r."
But I turn him down . I th ink I ' m better off alone for a wh i l e , I tel l h i m .
Oshima brushes t h e strands o f h a i r off h i s forehead. After hes itating a b i t
h e says , " I know I ' m a hopeless, damaged, homosexual woman , a n d if that's
what's bothering you . . . "
" N o ," I say, "that's not it at a l l . I j ust need some time alone to th ink. Too
many th ings have happened all at once. That's all."
Oshima writes down a phone number on a memo pad. "In the middle of
the night, if you feel l ike talking to anybody, call th is number. Don't hesitate ,
okay? I ' m a l ight sleeper anyway." I thank h i m .

That's t h e night I s e e a ghost.

Chapter 22

T

h e truck Nakata was riding in arrived i n Kobe j ust after five i n th e
morning. It was l ight out, but th e warehouse was still closed and the i r
freight c o u l d n ' t be unloaded. They parked t h e truck i n a b road street

near the harbor and took a nap. The young driver stretched out on th e back
seat - h i s usual spot for napping - and was soon snoring away contentedly.
H i s snores sometimes woke Nakata up, but each time he quickly dropped
back i nto a comfortable sleep. Insomnia was one phenomenon Nakata had
n ever experienced.
A l i ttle before eight the young driver sat up and gave a big yawn . " H ey,
Cramps, ya hungry? " h e asked. He was busy shaving with an electric razor,
using the rearview mi rror.
" N ow that you mention it, yes , Nakata does feel a l i ttle hungry."
"We l l , let's go grab some breakfast."
From the time they left Fu j i gawa to their arrival i n Kobe , Nakata had
spent most of the time sleeping. The young driver barely said a word the
whole time, j ust drove on, l i stening to a late-night radio show. Occasionally
h e 'd s i n g along to a song, none of wh ich Nakata had ever heard before . He
wondered i f they were even i n Japanese, since h e could barely understand
any of the lyric s , j ust the occasional word . From his bag h e took out th e
chocolate and rice balls he'd gotten from th e two young office girls i n S h in­
j u k u , and shared th e m .
T h e driver had chain-smoked , saying it h elped k e e p h i m awake , so
Nakata's c lothes were reeking of smoke by the time they arrived i n Kob e .
Bag and umbrella i n h a n d , Nakata clambered down from t h e truck.
"You better leave that stuff in the truck," the drive r said. "We 're not going
fa r, and we'll come right back after we eat."
"Yes, you're qu ite right, but Nakata feels better having the m . "
T h e young man frowned. "Whatever. It's not l ike
around. I t's u p to you . "

I'm l u gging the m

"Much obliged."
"My name's Hoshino, by th e way. Spelled th e same as the former man­
ager of the C h u n i c h i Dragons. We 're not related , though ."
" M r. Hoshino, is it? Very glad to meet you . My name is Nakata ."
"Come on - I knew that already," Hosh ino said.

H e knew th e neighborhood and strode off down the street, Nakata a l most
havi ng to trot to keep up. They wound up i n a small diner down a back street,
seated among oth e r truck drivers and stevedores from the docks . Not a s i ngle
necktie i n sight. Al l of them were intently shove l i n g i n th eir breakfasts l ike
they were fi l l i n g up a gas tank. The place was filled with the clatter of
dishes, the wa itress yel l ing out orders , the morning NHK n ews o n the TV
buzzing in the corner.
Hoshino pointed to the menu taped to the wal l . "Just order whatever you
want, Gramps. The food's cheap here, and pretty good ."
"All right," Nakata said, and did as he was told, staring at the m e nu until
h e remembered h e couldn't read. " I ' m sorry, Mr. Hosh i n o , but I'm not very
bright and can't read ."
"Is that right?" Hoshino said, amazed. "Can't read? That's pretty rare
these days . But that's okay. I ' m having the grilled fish and omelette - why
don't you get th e same?"
"That sounds good . Grilled fish and omelettes are some of Nakata 's
favorites."
"Glad to hear it."
" I e n j oy eel a lot, too ."
"Yeah? I l ike eel myself. But eel's not someth i n g you have i n the morn­
ing, is it."
"That's right. And Nakata had eel last night, when Mr. Hagita bought
some for m e . "
" G l a d t o hear i t , " Hosh ino said aga i n . "Two orders of t h e gril l e d fish s e t
plus omelettes ! " h e yelled out t o t h e wa itress. "And super-size one of t h e
r i c e s , okay?"
"Two grilled fish sets, plus omelettes ! One rice super-size ! " th e wa itress
called loudly to the cooks .
"Isn't it kind of a pain, not being able to read ? " Hosh ino aske d .
"Yes, sometimes I have trouble because I c a n ' t rea d . A s l o n g as I stay i n
Nakano Ward i n Tokyo it's not so b a d , but if I g o somewh e re else, l ike n ow,
it's very hard for me."

" I guess so. Kobe 's pretty far from Nakano."
"Nakata doesn't know north and south . All I know is left and right. So I
get lost, and can't buy tickets , either."
" I n c redible you were able to get th is far."
"Many people were kind enough to help m e . You 're one of the m ,
M r . Hosh i n o . I don't know how t o thank you ."
"That must be tough , th ough , not being able to read. My grandad was
pretty senile, but h e could still read well enough ."
" I'm especially dumb."
" I s everybody i n your family l ike that?"
"No, they aren't. My older brother is a depart mint head at a place called
Itoh-chew, and my younger brother works at an office called Em-i-tee-i."
"Wow," Hoshino said. " Pretty el ite bunch. So you 're the only one who's a
b i t off, h u h ? "
"Yes, Nakata's t h e only o n e who h a d an accident and i s n ' t bright. That's
why I ' m always being told not to go out too much and cause any trouble for
my brothers, nieces, and neph ews ."
"Yeah , I guess most people would find it kind of awkward to have some­
one l ike you show up."
" I don't understand difficult th ings, but I know that as long as I stay in
Nakano Ward I don't get lost. The Governor helped me out, and I got along
well with cats . Once a month I got my hair cut and every once i n a wh i l e I 'd
eat e e l . But after Johnnie Walker, Nakata couldn't stay in Nakano a nymore . "
"Joh nnie Walker?"
"That's right. H e has boots and a tall black hat, and a vest and walking
stick. H e collects cats to get their souls."
"You don't say . . . ," Hosh ino sa id. " I don't have much patience with
long stories . So anyway, someth i ng happened and you left Naka n o , right? "
"That's right. I left Nakano."
"So where are you headed?"
"Nakata doesn't know yet. But after we got here I knew I had to go across
a bridge . A big bridge near here."
"Ah , so you 're goi ng to Sh ikoku ."
"I' m very sorry, Mr. Hosh ino, but I don't know geography very wel l . If
you go over the bridge are you in Sh ikoku?"
"Yeah . I f you 're talking about a big bridge around here, that's th e one to
S h ikoku . There 're three of them , actually. One goes fro m Kobe to Awa j i
I sla n d , the n o n to Tokush ima. Another goes from below Kur a s h i k i over to
Saka i d e . And one connects Onomichi and I mabari. One bridge would've

been plenty, but pol iticians stuck th eir noses into it and they wou nd up with
thre e . Typ ical pork-barrel pro j e cts ." Hoshino poured out some water onto the
res i n tabletop and drew an abbreviated map of Japan with his fi nger, i n dicat­
ing the three bri dges connecting Honshu and Sh ikoku .
"Are these bridges really big?" Nakata aske d .
"They're huge."
" I s that right? Anyway, Nakata 's going to cross over one of th e m . Probably
wh ichever one i s cl osest. I'll figure out what to do after that later o n . "
" S o w h a t you 're saying is y o u d o n ' t have a n y fri ends or anybody where
you 're headed ? "
" N o , Nakata doesn't know anybody th ere."
"You 're j ust going to cross the bridge to Sh ikoku and th e n go somewhere else."
"That's right."
"And you don't know where that somewh ere is."
" I have no i d e a . But I th ink I ' l l know it wh en I get th ere."
"Jeez," Hoshino said. H e brushed back h i s hair, gave his ponyta il a tug,
and put on his C h u n i c h i Dragons cap.

Their food was served , and they started eati ng.
" Pretty good omel ette , huh?" Hoshino asked.
"Yes, it's very good. It tastes different from the omelettes I always eat i n
Nakano."
"That's 'cause it's Ka nsai styl e . Not at all l ike th ose tasteless flat th ings
that pass as omelettes in Tokyo ."
The two of the m then s i l ently e n j oyed th eir meal , the omelettes , salt­
gri lled mackerel , miso soup with shellfish, pickled tu rnips, seasoned spinach,
seawee d . They didn't leave a grain of rice. Nakata made sure to chew each
bite thi rty-two ti mes, so it took quite a wh ile for h i m to finish.
"Get enough , M r. Nakata ? "
"Yes, plenty. H ow about you , Mr. Hosh ino?"
" Even m e , I ' m stuffed. Perks up the old spirits , doesn't it, to have such a
great breakfast? "
"Yes, it certainly does."
" H ow 'bout it? Gatta take a dump?"
"Now that you mention it, I do feel l ike it."
"Go right ahead. Toi l et's over th ere."
"Wh at about you , M r. Hoshino?"

' ' I ' l l go later o n . Take my time about it."
"Thank you . Nakata will go take a dump, the n ."
" H ey, not so loud. People are still eating here."
'T m sorry. Nakata's not very bright."
" Never mind. Just go ."
"Do you mind if I brush my teeth , too? "
"No, g o ahead. We got t i m e . Do whatever y o u want. Tel l y o u what, I
don't th ink you ' l l be needing that umbrella. You're j ust going to the toilet,
right? "
"All right. I ' l l l eave the umbrella."
Wh en Nakata came back from the toilet Hosh ino had already paid
th eir b i l l .
" M r. Hosh ino, I have money with me, s o please l e t me at least p a y for
b reakfast."
Hoshino shook his head. "It's okay. l owe my grandpa b ig ti m e . Back th e n
I w a s kind of w i l d . "
" I see. But I ' m n o t y o u r grandfath er."
"That's my problem, so don't worry about it. No a rgu ments , okay? Just let
me treat you ."
After a moment's thought Nakata decided to acc ept the you n g m a n 's
gen e rosity. "Thank you so much th e n . It was a wonderful meal."
" H ey, it's j ust some mackerel and omel ettes at a noth i n g l i ttle diner.
No need to bow l ike that."
"But you know, Mr. Hosh ino, ever since Nakata left Nakano Ward eve ry­
one's been so nice to me I haven't had to use hardly any money at a l l ."
" Sweet," Hosh ino said, impressed .
Nakata had a wa itress fill his little th ermos with hot tea , th e n he carefully
replaced it i n his bag. Walking back to where the truck was parke d , Hosh i n o
said, " S o , about th is going t o Sh ikoku th ing . . . "
"Yes?" Nakata repl ied.
"Why do you want to go there?"
" I don't know."
"You don't know why you 're going, or even wh e re you 're going. B u t
you 've s t i l l g o t t o g o t o Sh ikoku ? "
"That's right. Nakata's going t o cross a big bridge ."
"Th i ngs 'll be clearer once you 're on the other side?"
" I th ink so. I won't know anyth ing until I cross th e bridge ."
" H m m ," Hosh ino said. " S o crossing that bri dge i s very important."

19 4

"Yes, that's more important than anyth ing."
" M a n al ive," Hosh i no said, scratc h i ng h i s head.

The young man had to drive h i s truck over to the warehouse to del iver his
load of fu rnitur e , so h e told Nakata to wa it for h i m at a small park near the
harbor.
" Don't move from here, okay? " Hosh ino cautioned h i m . "Th e re 's a rest­
room over th ere, and a water founta i n . You got everyth ing you n e e d . If you
wander off somewhere, you might not find your way back."
" I understan d . I'm not in Nakano Ward anymore ."
"Exactly. Th is isn't Nakano. So sit tight, and I'll be back real soon."
"All right. I ' l l stay right here."
"Good . I'll be back as soon as I finish my del ivery."
Nakata did as he was tol d , not moving from the bench , not even to use
the restroom . H e didn't find stayi ng put i n one place for a long time very
hard. S i tting sti l l , in fact, was h i s specialty.
He could see the sea from where he sat. Th is he hadn't seen for a long,
long time. Wh e n h e was l ittl e , h e a n d his family h a d gone t o t h e seaside any
number of ti mes. H e 'd put on tru nks, splash around on the shore, gath er
seash ells at l ow ti de. But these memories weren't cl ear. It was l ike th is had
taken place i n another worl d . Since the n , h e couldn't recall seeing the sea
even once.
After the strange incident i n th e h i lls of Yam an as hi, Nakata went back to
school i n Tokyo . H e 'd regained consciousness and physically was fi n e , but his
memory had been wiped clean , and he never regained the a b i l i ty to read and
write . H e couldn't read his school textbooks , and couldn't take any tests . Al l
the knowledge h e 'd gained up till th en had vanished, as had the abil ity, to a
great extent, to th ink in abstract terms. Sti l l , th ey let h i m graduate . H e
c o u l d n ' t follow w h a t w a s b e i n g taught, and in stead s a t qui etly i n a c o r n e r o f
t h e classroom. Whe n t h e teacher told h i m t o do someth i ng, h e fol l owed h e r
i nstructions t o t h e l e tter. H e d i d n ' t bother anyone, so teach e rs tended t o for­
get he was even th ere . He was more l ike a guest sitting in than a b u rd e n .
People s o o n forgot that u ntil t h e accident he'd always gotten stra ight As .
But now the school activities and events took place without h i m . H e didn't
make any friends. None of th is bothered him, th ough . Being left alone meant
h e could be lost i n h i s own l i ttle world. What absorbed him th e most at
school was taking care of the rabb its and goats they ra ised th ere, tending the

19 5

fl ower beds outside and cleaning the classrooms. A constant smile on h i s
fac e , he never tired o f these chores.
H e was essentially forgotten about at home, too. Once they learned that
their eldest son couldn't read anymore or follow along with his lessons,
Nakata's parents - totally focused on their c h i ldren's education - ignored
him and turned their attention to his younger brothers. I t was impossible for
Nakata to go on to publ ic j unior h igh, so once he graduated from elementary
school he was sent to l ive with relatives in Nagano Prefectur e , in h i s mother's
hometown. There he attended agriculture school . S i n c e h e still couldn't read
h e had a hard time with his schoolwork, but h e loved working i n the fields.
H e might even have become a farmer, if his classmates hadn't tormented h i m
s o muc h . They e n j oyed beating u p th is outsider, th i s city k i d , s o muc h . H i s
i n j uries became so severe ( o n e cauliflower e a r included) that h i s grand­
parents pulled him out of school and kept him at home to help out around
the house. Nakata was a quiet, obedi ent child, and his grandparents loved
him very muc h .
I t w a s about th is t i m e that he discovered h e c o u l d speak with cats. H i s
grandparents h a d a few cats around the house, and Nakata became good
friends with the m . At fi rst he was able to speak only a few words, but he
knuckl ed down l ike h e was trying to master a foreign language and before
long was able to carry on extended conversations. Whenever h e was free h e
l iked t o s i t on the porch a n d talk with the cats . For their part, the cats taught
him a lot about nature and th e world around h i m . Actually almost all the
basic knowledge h e had about th e world and how it worked h e learned fro m
h i s fel i n e friends.
At fifteen h e was sent to a nearby furniture company to learn woodwork­
ing. It was less a factory than a small woodworking shop making folkcraft-type
furniture. C h a i rs , tables, and chests made there were sh ipped to Tokyo .
Nakata grew to l ove woodworking. H i s boss took a great liking to h i m , for h e
was skilled with h i s hands, never skipped any small details, didn't talk m u c h ,
and n ever, ever complained. Reading a blueprint and a d d i n g figures were n ' t
h i s forte , but a s i d e from these tasks h e did w e l l at everyth ing h e set h i s h a n d
to . Once h e got th e manufacturing steps i n h i s mind h e c o u l d repeat them
endlessly, tirelessly. After a two-year apprenticesh ip h e was given ful l-ti me
employment.
Nakata worked there until he was past fifty, never once having an acci­
dent or calling i n sick. H e didn't drink or smoke , didn't stay up late or overeat.
H e never watched TV, and listened to the radio only for th e Illorning exercise
program . Day after day he j ust made furniture . His grandparents eventually

passed away, as did h i s parents . Everybody liked h i m , though he didn't make
any close friends. Perhaps that was only to be expecte d . Wh e n most people
tri ed talking to Nakata , ten minutes was all it took for th e m to ru n out of
th ings to say.
Stil l , h e n ever felt lonely or unhappy. H e n ever felt sexual desire, or even
wanted to be with anyo n e . H e understood he was different from oth e r peopl e .
Though no o n e else noticed th is, he th ought h i s shadow on the ground was
paler, l i ghter, than that of other peopl e . The only ones who really u n d e rstood
him were the cats . On days off he'd sit on a park bench and spend the whole
day chatti ng with th e m . Strangely enough, with cats he n ever ran out of
th i ngs to talk about.
The owne r of th e furniture company passed away when Nakata was fifty­
two , and the woodworking shop was closed soon afterward . That kind of
gloomy, dark, traditional fu rniture didn't sell as well as it used to. The c rafts­
men were all getting on i n years , and no young people were i n te rested i n
learning the trade. The shop itself, originally in th e middle of a fi e l d , was n ow
surrounded by n ewly built homes, and compla ints started to come in about
both the noise and th e smoke when th ey burned wood shavi ngs . The own er's
son, who worked in town for an accounting firm, had no i nterest in taking
over th e business, so as soon as h i s fath er passed away h e sold the property to
a real estate developer. For h i s part, th e developer tore d own th e shop, had
the land grade d , and sold it to an apartment complex developer, who con­
structed a six-story condomi n i u m on the property. Every s i ngle apartment in
the condo sold out on the first day they were put on sal e .
That's h o w Nakata lost h i s j o b . T h e company h a d s o m e outstanding
loans to pay off, so h e received only a pittance as reti rement pay. Afterward h e
couldn't find anoth er j ob . Who was goi ng t o h i re an ill iterate m a n i n h i s
fifties whose o n l y s k i l l was crafting antique furniture nobody wanted any­
more?
Nakata had worked steadily for th i rty-seven years at th e plant without tak­
ing a single day of leave , so h e did have a fa ir amount of money i n h i s savings
account at the local post offi c e . He generally spent very l i ttle on h i mself, so
even without finding an other job he should have been able to have a comfort­
able old age on h i s savings . S i n c e he couldn't read or write , a cousin of h i s
w h o worked at city h a l l managed h i s account for h i m . Though kind enough ,
th is cousin wasn't so quick on th e uptake a n d was tricked into investing i n a
condomi n i u m at a ski resort by an unscrupulous real estate broker and ended
up deeply i n debt. Around th e same time that Nakata lost h i s j o b , th is cousin
disappeared with h i s entire family to escape h i s creditors . Some yakuza-type

19 7

loan sharks were after h i m , apparently. Nobody knew where th is fa mily was ,
or even if they were still al ive .
Whe n Nakata had an acquaintance go with h i m to the post office to
check on the balance in his account, he found out that only a few h u ndred
dollars were left. His reti rement pay, wh ich had been deposited di rectly into
the account, had also vanished. One could only say that Nakata was ex­
tremely unlucky - losing his job and finding h i mself penniless. H i s relatives
were sympatheti c , but they'd been asked to put up collateral and l ikewise lost
everyth ing they'd invested with the cous i n . So none of the m had the
resources to help Nakata i n his time of need.
I n the end the older of Nakata's two younger brothers i n Tokyo decided
to look after h i m for the time being. H e owned a small apartment b u ilding in
Nakano that catered to si ngle men - th is was part of h i s inheritance fro m his
parents - and he offered one of the units to his older brother. H e also looked
after the money h i s parents had willed to Nakata - not a great amount - and
arranged for h i m to receive a subsidy for the mentally challenged from the
Tokyo M etropol itan Government. That was th e extent of the brothe r's "care."
Despite h i s illite racy, Nakata was able to take care of h i s daily needs by h i m­
self, and as long as his rent was covered he was able to manage .
H i s two brothers had very little contact with h i m . They saw h i m a few
times when he fi rst moved back to Tokyo , but that was it. They had l ived apart
for over th i rty years, and their lifestyl es were too different. Neither broth e r
had a n y particular fee l i ngs toward h i m , a n d i n a n y c a s e they were t o o busy
with their own careers to take care of a retarded sibling.
But th is cold treatment by his relatives didn't faze Nakata. H e was used to
being alone and actually tensed up if people went out of th eir way to be nice
to him. H e wasn't angry, either, that h i s cousin had squandered h i s l i fe sav­
i n gs . Naturally he understood it was too bad it happened, but he wasn't disap­
pointed by the whole affair. Nakata had no idea what a resort condo was , o r
what " i nvesti ng" meant, n o r d i d he understand w h a t taking out a "loan "
i nvolved. He l ived in a world circumscribed by a very l i m i ted vocabulary.
Only amou nts up to fifty dollars or so had any meaning to h i m . Anyth i n g
above that - a thousand dollars, ten thousand, a hundred thousan d - was a l l
the same to him. A

lot of money, that's a l l it meant. H e might have savings ,

but he'd n ever seen it. They j ust told h i m , "Th is is h ow much you have i n
you r accou nt," and told h i m an amount, wh ich t o h i m w a s an abstract c o n ­
cept. So w h e n it all vanished he never h a d t h e s e n s e that h e 'd actually l ost
someth ing real .

So Nakata l ived a contented l i fe in the small apartment h i s brother pro­
vided, receiving h i s monthly subsidy, using h i s special bus pass, goi n g to the
local park to chat with the cats . Th is l i ttle corner of Nakano became h i s new
worl d . Just like dogs and cats, he marked off h i s territory, a boundary l i n e
beyond w h i c h , except i n unusual circumstances, he never ventu red . A s long
as he stayed there h e felt safe and content. No dissatisfactions, no anger at
anyth ing. No fee l i ngs of loneli ness, anxieties about th e future, or worries that
his l i fe was difficult or inconvenient. Day after day, for more than ten years ,
th is was h i s l i fe , l eisurely e n j oying whatever came along.
Until the day that Johnnie Walker showed up.

Nakata hadn't seen the sea i n years, for there was no sea i n Nagano Prefecture,
or i n Nakano Ward . Now for th e fi rst time , h e realized that h e 'd lost the sea
for so long. H e hadn't even thought about it all those many years . H e nodded
several times to h i mself, confirming th is fact. H e took off his hat, rubbed h i s
closely-cropped h ead with h i s p a l m , p u t h i s h a t back o n , and gazed out at th e
sea. This is the extent of h i s knowledge of the sea: it was very big, it was salty,
and fish l ived th e re .
He sat there on th e bench , breath ing in the scent of t h e s e a , watc h i n g
seagulls c i r c l e overhead, gazing a t s h i p s anchored far offshore . H e d i d n ' t tire
of the view. An occasional wh ite seagull would al ight on the fresh summer
grass i n the park. The wh ite aga i nst the green was beautifu l . Nakata tried call­
ing out to the seagu l l as it walked over the grass, but it didn't reply and j ust
stared at him coolly. There were no cats around. The only animals i n the
park were seagu l l s and spa rrows . As he sipped hot tea from his thermos, ra i n
began pelting down , and Nakata opened up h i s precious umbre l l a .

By t h e time Hoshino came b a c k t o t h e park, j ust before twelve , it had stopped
ra ining. Nakata was seated on th e bench j ust as he'd l e ft h i m , umbrella
folded, staring out at the sea . Hoshino had parked h i s truck somewhere and
arrived i n a taxi .
" H ey, I ' m sorry it took so long," he apologized. A vinyl B oston bag h u n g
from h i s shoulder. H I th ought I 'd be finished s o o n e r but all kinds of th i ngs
came up. It's l ike every department store has one guy who's got to be a pain in
the butt."
"Nakata didn't mind at all. I was j ust sitting here, looking at the sea."

19 9

" H m m ," Hoshino murmured . He looked out in the same directi o n , but
all h e saw was a shabby old pier and oil floating on the surface of the water.
"I haven't seen the sea in a long time."
"That right?"
"The last time I saw it was i n elementary schoo l . I went to the seaside at
Enoshima."
" I bet that was a long time ago."
"Japan was occupied by the Americans back the n . The seashore at
Enoshima was filled with American soldiers."
"You gotta be kidding."
"No, I'm not kidding."
"Come on," Hosh ino said. "Japan was never occupied by America."
"Nakata doesn't know th e details, but America had planes called B-29 s .
T h e y dropped a lot of bombs on Tokyo , so I w e n t t o Yamanashi Prefecture.
That's where I got sick."
"Yeah? Whatever . . . I told you I don't l ike long stories. Anyway, l et's
head on out. It took longer than I thought, and it's gonna be dark soon if we
don't get a move on."
"Whe re are we going?"
" S h ikoku, of cours e . We 'll cross the bridge . You said you 're goi n g to
Sh ikoku , didn't you ? "
" I d i d . But what about your job?"
"Don't worry about it. It'll still be there whe n I get back. I 've been putting
i n some long hours and was th inking I should take a few days off. To tel l the
truth , I 've never been to Sh ikoku either. Might as well check it out. Plus you
can't read, right? So it'll be a whole lot easier if I ' m with you to help buy the
tickets . Unl ess you don't want me along."
"No, Nakata would be happy to have you along."
"Then let's do it. I al ready checked out the bus schedul e . S h ikoku - h e re
we cOIl1e ! "

Chapter 23

I

d o n ' t know i f ghost is t h e right word , b u t it definitely i s n ' t someth i ng o f
th is world - that m u c h I can tell at a glance.
I sense someth ing and suddenly wake up and there she i s . It's the

middle of the night but the room is strangely l ight, moonlight strea ming
th rough th e window. I know I closed the curtains before goi ng to bed, but
now they're wide ope n . The girl's silhouette is clearly outl i n e d , bathed by the
bone wh ite l ight of the moon .
S h e 's about my age , fifteen or s ixteen. I ' m guess ing fi ftee n . There 's a b i g
difference between fi ft e e n and sixte e n . She's s m a l l and s l i m , holds h erself
erect, and doesn't seem deli cate at all. Her hair ha ngs down to her shoulders,
with bangs on h e r forehead. She's wearing a blue dress with a b i llowing hem
that's j ust the right length . She doesn't have any shoes or socks on. The but­
tons on th e c uffs of her dress are neatly done up. H e r dress has a rounded,
open collar, showing off her well-formed neck.
S h e 's sitti n g at the desk, c h i n resti ng i n her hands, staring at th e wall and
th inking about someth i ng. Noth ing too complex, I 'd say. It l ooks more l ike
she's lost i n some pleasant, warm me mory of not so long ago . Every once i n a
wh ile a h i n t of a smile gath ers at the corners of her mouth . But the shadows
cast by th e moonlight keep me from making out any deta i l s of her expression .
I don 't want to i nterrupt whatever it is she's doing, so I pretend to be asleep,
holding my b reath and trying not to be noticed.
S h e 's got to be a ghost. First of all, she's j ust too beautifu l . H e r features
are gorgeous, but it's not only that. She's so perfect I know she can't be rea l .
She's l i k e a person w h o stepped right o u t o f a dream. T h e purity of her beauty
gives me a fee l i n g close to sadness - a very natural fee l i ng, though one that
only someth i n g extraordi nary could produce .
I ' m wrapped in my covers, holding my breath . She continues to sit there
at th e desk, chin propped i n her hands, barely stirring. Occasi onally h e r
chin sh ifts a fraction , changing t h e angle of her h e a d ever so sl ightly. A s far as

2 0 1

anyth ing moving in the room, that's it. I can see the large flowe ring dogwood
j ust outside the window, glistening silently i n the moonl ight. There's no
wind, and I can't hear a sound. The whole th ing feels l ike I might've died,
unknowingly. I ' m dead, and th is girl and I have Slink to the bottom of a deep
crater lake .
All of a sudden she pulls her hands away from her c h i n and places th e m
on her lap. Two s m a l l p a l e knees show a t h e r h e m l i n e . She stops gaz i n g at the
wall and turns in my direction. She reaches up and touches the hair at her
forehead - her sl i m , girlish fingers rest for a time on her forehead, as if she's
trying to draw out some forgotten thought.

She 's looking at me. My heart beats

dully in my chest, but strangely enollgh I don't feel l ike I ' m being l ooked at.
Maybe she's not looking at me but beyond me.
I n the depths of our crater lake , everyth ing is silent. The volcano's been
extinct for ages. Layer upon layer of solitude, l ike folds of soft mud. Th e l i ttl e
bit of l ight that manages to penetrate to th e depths l i ghts up the surroundi ngs
l ike the rema ins of some fa int, distant memory. At these depths there's no sign
of l i fe . I don't know how long she looks at me - not at m e , maybe , but at the
spot where I am. Time's rules don't apply here . Ti me expands, th e n con­
tracts , all i n tu ne with th e stirri ngs of the heart.
And th e n , without warning, the girl stands up and heads towa rd the door
on her slender legs . The door is shut, yet soundlessly she disappears .
I stay where I am, in bed. My eyes open j ust a slit, and I don't m ove a
mus c l e . For all I know she might come back, I th ink. I

want her to, I real i z e .

B u t no matter how long I wa it s h e doesn't retu rn . I ra ise my h e a d and glance
at the fluorescent numbers on the alarm clock n ext to my bed. 3 : 2 5 . I get
out of bed, walk over to the chair she was sitti ng on, and touch it. It's not
warm at all . I check out the desktop, i n hopes of finding someth i ng - a
s i ngle hair, perhaps? - she left behind. But there's noth i ng. I sit down o n
t h e c h a i r , massagi ng m y cheeks with the palms of my h a n d s , and breathe a
deep sigh .
I close the curta ins and crawl back under th e covers, but there's no way I
can go back to sleep now. My head's too full of that enigmatic girl . A strange ,
terri fic force unl ike anyth ing I 've ever experienced is sprouti ng in my heart,
taking root th ere, growing. Shut up behind my rib cage , my warm heart
expands and contracts independent of my will - ove r and over.
I switch on th e l ight and wait for the dawn , sitting up i n bed. I can't read ,
can't l isten to mus i c . I can't do anyth ing but j ust sit there, wa iting for morn­
ing to come. As the sky begins to l ighten I finally sleep a bit. When I wake u p ,
my pillow's c o l d and damp with tears . B u t tears for what? I have no idea .

202

Around nine Oshima roars up in h i s M iata, and we get the l ibrary ready to
open. After we get everyth ing done I make h i m some coffe e . He taught me
how to do it j ust right. You grind the beans by hand, boil up some water i n a
narrow spouted pot, let it sit for a wh i l e , then slowly - and I mean

slowly ­

pour the water through a paper filter. When the coffee's ready Osh i m a puts i n
th e small est dab of sugar, j ust for show, basically, but no c r e a m - t h e b e s t way,
he insists . I make myself some Earl Grey tea .
Osh ima has on a s h i ny brown short-sleeved shirt and white l i n e n
trousers. W i p i n g h is glasses with a brand-new handkerchief h e pulls from h i s
pocket, h e turns t o m e . "You don't look l ike you got m u c h sleep."
"There's someth ing I 'd l ike you to do for m e ," I say.
"Naln e it."
" I want to l isten to ' Kafka on the Shore.' Can you get hold of the record ? "
" N o t t h e C D? "
" I f possible I 'd l ike to l isten t o the record, t o hear h ow it originally
sounded. Of course we'd have to find a record player, too."
Osh ima rests h i s fi ngers on h i s te mple and th inks. "There might be a n
old stereo i n t h e storeroom. C a n ' t guarantee it still works , though ."
We go i nto a small room facing th e parking lot. There are n o w i ndows ,
only a skyl ight h igh up. A mess of objects from various periods are strewn
around - furniture, dishes, magazines, clothes, and paintings. Some of the m
a r e obviously valuabl e , but s o m e , most, i n fact, d o n ' t l o o k l ike they're worth
muc h .
" S o meday we've got t o g e t r i d of all th is j unk," Osh i m a remarks, "but
nobody's been brave e nough to take th e plunge."
I n the middle of the roo m , where time seems to have drifted to a halt, we
find a n old Sansui stereo. C overed i n a th i n layer of white dust, the stereo
itself l ooks i n good shape, though it must be ove r twenty-five years s i n c e th is
was up-to-date audio equipment. The whole set cons ists of a receiver, amp,
turntable, and bookshelf speakers. We also find a collection of old LPs ,
mostly sixties pop music - Beatles, Stones, Beach B oys , S i m o n a n d Gar­
funke l , Stevie Wonder. About thi rty albums, all tol d . I take some out of th eir
j ackets. Whoever l istened to these took good care of th e m , because there's no
trace of mold and not a scratch anywhere.
There's a guitar i n the storeroom as well , still with strings . Plus a pile of
old magaz ines I 've n ever heard of, and an ol d-fashioned te nnis racket. All l ike
the ru ins of some not-so-distant past.

203

" I imagine all th is stuff belonged to Miss Saeki's boyfriend," Oshima says .
"Like I mentioned, he used to l ive in th is building, and they must've thrown
h i s th i ngs down here. The stereo, though , looks more recent than that."
We lug the stereo and records to my room. We dust it off, plug it in, con­
nect up the player and amp, and hit the switc h . The l i ttle green l ight on the
amp comes on and th e turntable begins to revolve . 1 check the cartridge and
find it still has a decent needle, then take out the red vinyl record of " Sgt.
Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" and put it on the turntab l e . The famil iar
guitar intro sta rts to play. Th e sound's much cleaner than 1 expecte d .
"Japan has i t s share o f problems," Oshima says , s m i l i ng, "but w e sure
know how to make a sound system. Th is th ing hasn't been used i n ages, but it
sti l l sounds great."
We l i sten to the Beatles album for a wh i l e . C ompared to the CD vers i o n ,
it s o u n d s like different m u s i c altogether.
"We l l , we've got someth ing to l isten to it o n ," Osh i ma concludes, "but
getting hold of a s i ngle of ' Kafka on the Shore' might be a prob l e m . That's
a pretty rare item nowadays . I tell you what - I ' l l ask my mother. S h e 's prob­
ably got a copy tucked away somewh ere. Or at least she'll know somebody
who does."
1 nod.

Oshima ra ises a fi nger, l ike a teacher warni ng a pupil . "One th ing,
though . Make sure you n ever play it when M iss Saeki 's here. No matter what.
Understood?"
I nod aga i n .
"Like i n

Casablanca," he says , a n d h u m s t h e opening bars of "As Time

Goes By." "Just don't play that one song, okay?"
"Osh ima, th ere 's someth ing 1 want to ask. Does any fifteen-year-old girl
come here?"
"By

here you mean the library? "

1 nod.

Oshima tilts h i s head and gives it some thought. "Not as far as 1 know," he
says , staring at me l ike he's l ooking into the room from a window. "That's a
strange th ing to ask."
" I th ink 1 saw her recently," 1 say.
"Wh e n was th is?"
" Last night."
"You saw a fifteen-year-old girl here last night?"
"Yeah ."
"What kind of girl ? "

I blush a bit. "Just a girl. Hair down to her shoulders. Wearing a blue
dress. "
"Was she pretty?"
I nod.
"Could be a sexual fantasy, " Oshima says, and grins. "The world's full of
weird things. But for a healthy, heterosexual kid your age, having fantasies
like that's not so strange. "
I remember how Oshima saw me buck naked up at the cabin, and blush
even more.

During our lunch break Oshima quietly hands me a single of "Kafka on
the Shore " in a square little jacket. "Turns out my mom did have one. Five
copies, if you can believe it. She really takes good care of things. A bit of a
pack rat, but I guess we shouldn't complain. "
"Thanks," I say.
I go back to my room and take the record out of the jacket. The record
looks like it's never been played. In the record jacket's photo, Miss Saeki­
she was nineteen, according to Oshima-is sitting at a piano in a recording
studio. Looking straight at the camera, she's resting her chin in her hands on
the music stand, her head tilted slightly to one side, a shy, unaffected smile
on her face, closed lips spread pleasantly wide, with charming lines at the cor­
ners. It doesn't look like she's wearing any makeup. Her hair's held back by a
plastic clip so it won't fall into her face, and part of her right ear's visible
through the strands. Her light blue dress is short and loose-fitting, and she has
a silver bracelet on her left wrist, her only accessory. A pair of slender sandals
lie next to her piano stool, and her bare feet are lovely.
She looks like a symbol of something. A certain time, a certain place. A
certain state of mind. She's like a spirit that's sprung up from a happy chance
encounter. An eternal, naive innocence, never to be marred, floats around
her like spores in spring. Time had come to a standstill in this photograph.
1969-a scene from long before I was even born.
I knew from the first that the young girl who visited my room last night
was Miss Saeki. I never doubted it for a second, but just had to make sure.
Compared to when she was fifteen, Miss Saeki at nineteen looks more
grown-up, more mature. If I had to compare the two, I'd say the outline of her
face looks sharper, more defined, in the photo. A certain anxiousness is miss­
ing from the older of the two. But otherwise this nineteen-year-old and the
fifteen-year-old I saw are nearly identical. The smile in the photo's the same

:05

one I saw last night. How she held her chin in her hands, and tilted her
head-also the same. And in Miss Saeki now, the

real-time Miss

Saeki, I can

see the same expressions and gestures. I'm delighted that those features, and
her sense of the otherworldly, haven't changed a bit. Even her build is almost
the same.
Still, there's something in this photo of the nineteen-year-old that the
middle-aged woman I know has lost forever. You might call it an outpouring
of energy. Nothing showy, it's colorless, transparent, like fresh water secretly
seeping out between rocks-a kind of natural, unspoiled appeal that shoots
straight to your heart. That brilliant energy seeps out of her entire being as
she sits there at the piano. Just by looking at that happy smile, you can trace
the beautiful path that a contented heart must follow. Like a firefly's glow that
persists long after it's disappeared into the darkness.
I sit on my bed for a long time, record jacket in hand, not thinking about
anything, just letting time pass by. I open my eyes, go to the window, and take
a deep breath of fresh air, catching a whiff of the sea on the breeze that's
come up through a pine forest. What I saw here in this room the night before
was definitely Miss Saeki at age fifteen. The

real Miss Saeki, of course, is still

alive. A fifty-something woman, living a real life in the real world. Even now
she's in her room upstairs at her desk, working away. To see her, all I need
to do is go out of this room and up the stairs, and there she'll be. I can meet
her, talk with her-but none of that changes the fact that what I saw here
was her

ghost.

Oshima told me people can't be in two places at once, but I

think it's possible. In fact, I'm

sure

of it. While they're still alive, people can

become ghosts.
And there's another important fact: I'm drawn to that ghost, attracted to
her. Not to the Miss Saeki who's here right now, but to the fifteen-year-old
who

isn't. Very attracted, a feeling so strong

I can't explain it. And no matter

what anybody says, this is real. Maybe she doesn't really exist, but just think­
ing about her makes my heart-my flesh and blood, my

real

heart-thump

like mad. These feelings are as real as the blood all over my chest that awful
night.
As it gets near closing time Miss Saeki comes downstairs, her heels click­
ing as she walks. When I see her, I tense up and can hear my heart pounding.
I see the fifteen-year-old girl inside her. Like some small animal in hiber­
nation, she's curled up in a hollow inside Miss Saeki, asleep.
Miss Saeki's asking me something but I can't reply. I don't even know
what she said. I can hear her, of course-her words vibrate my eardrums and
transmit a message to my brain that's converted into language-but there's a

206

disconnect between words and meaning. Flustered, I blush and stammer out
something stupid. Oshima intervenes and answers her question. I nod at what
he's saying. Miss Saeki smiles, says good-bye to us, and leaves for home. I lis­
ten to the sound of her Golf as it exits the parking lot, fades into the distance,
and disappears.
Oshima stays behind and helps me close up for the night.
"By any chance have you fallen in love with somebody?" he asks. "You
seem kind of out of it."
I don't have any idea how I should respond. "Oshima, " I finally say, "this
is a pretty weird thing to ask, but do you think it's possible for someone to
become a ghost while they're still alive?"
He stops straightening up the counter and looks at me. "A very interest­
ing question, actually. Are you asking about the human spirit in a literary
sense-metaphorically, in other words? Or do you mean in actual fact?"
"More in actual fact, I guess, " I say.
"The assumption that ghosts really exist?"
"Right."
Oshima removes his glasses, wipes them with his handkerchief, and puts
them back on. "That's what's called a 'living spirit.' I don't know about in for­
eign countries, but that kind of thing appears a lot in Japanese literature. The

Tale of Genii,

for instance, is filled with living spirits. In the Heian period­

or at least in its psychological realm-on occasion people could become
living spirits and travel through space to carry out whatever desires they had.
Have you read

Genii?"

I shake my head.
"Our library has a couple of modern translations, so it might be a good
idea to read one. Anyway, an example is when Lady Rokujo-she's one of
Prince Genji's lovers-becomes so consumed with jealousy over Genji's
main wife, Lady Aoi, that she turns into an evil spirit that possesses her. Night
after night she attacks Lady Aoi in her bed until she finally kills her. Lady Aoi
was pregnant with Genji's child, and that news is what activated Lady
Rokujo's hatred. Genji called in priests to exorcise the evil spirit, but to no
avail. The evil spirit was impossible to resist.
"But the most interesting part of the story is that Lady Rokujo had no
inkling that she'd become a living spirit. She'd have nightmares and wake up,
only to discover that her long black hair smelled like smoke. Not having any
idea what was going on, she was totally confused. In fact, this smoke came
from the incense the priests lit as they prayed for Lady Aoi. Completely
unaware of it, she'd been flying through space and passing down the tunnel of

her subconscious into Aoi's bedroom. This is one of the most uncanny and
thrilling episodes in

Genji.

Later, when Lady Rokujo learns what she's been

doing, she regrets the sins she's committed and shaves off her hair and
renounces the world.
"The world of the grotesque is the darkness within us. Well before Freud
and Jung shined a light on the workings of the subconscious, this correlation
between darkness and our subconscious, these two forms of darkness, was
obvious to people. It wasn't a metaphor, even. If you trace it back further, it
wasn't even a correlation. Until Edison invented the electric light, most of
the world was totally covered in darkness. The physical darkness outside and
the inner darkness of the soul were mixed together, with no boundary separat­
ing the two. They were directly linked. Like this. " Oshima brings his two
hands together tightly.
"In Murasaki Shikibu's time living spirits were both a grotesque phenom­
enon and a natural condition of the human heart that was right there with
them. People of that period probably couldn't conceive of these two types of
darkness as separate from each other. But today things are different. The dark­
ness in the outside world has vanished, but the darkness in our hearts remains,
virtually unchanged. Just like an iceberg, what we label the ego or conscious­
ness is, for the most part, sunk in darkness. And that estrangement sometimes
creates a deep contradiction or confusion within us. "
"Around your mountain cabin-that's real darkness. "
"Absolutely, " Oshima says. "Real darkness still exists there. Sometimes
I go there just to experience it. "
"What triggers people to become living spirits? Is it always something
negative?"
'Tm no expert, but as far as I know, yes, those living spirits all spring up
out of negative emotions. Most of the extreme feelings people have tend to be
at once very individual and very negative. And these living spirits arise
through a kind of spontaneous generation. Sad to say, there aren't any cases
of a living spirit emerging to fulfill some logical premise or bring about world
peace. "
"What about because of love?"
Oshima sits down and thinks it over. 'That's a tough one. All I can tell
you is I've never run across an example. Of course, there is that tale, The
Chrysanthemum Pledge: in Tales of Moonlight and Rain. Have you read it?"
"No, " I reply.

"Tales of Moonlight and Rain

was written in the late Edo period by a

208

man named Ueda Akinari. It was set, however, in the earlier Warring States
period, which makes Ueda's approach a bit nostalgic or retro. Anyway, in this
particular story two samurai become fast friends and pledge themselves as
blood brothers. For samurai this was very serious. Being blood brothers meant
they pledged their lives to each other. They lived far away from each other,
each serving a different lord. One wrote to the other saying no matter what,
he would visit when the chrysanthemums were in bloom. The other said he'd
wait for his arrival. But before the first one could set out on the journey, he
got mixed lip in some trouble in his domain, was put under confinement,
and wasn't allowed to go out or send a letter. Finally summer is over and fall
is upon them, the season when the chrysanthemums blossom. At this rate
he won't be able to fulfill his promise to his friend. To a samurai, nothing's
more important than a promise. Honor's more important than your life. So
this samurai commits hara-kiri, becomes a spirit, and races across the miles to
visit his friend. They sit near the chrysanthemums and talk to their heart's
content, and then the spirit vanishes from the face of the earth. It's a beauti­
ful tale."
"But he had to die in order to become a spirit."
"Yes, that's right, " Oshima says. " It would appear that people can't be­
come living spirits out of honor or love or friendship. To do that they have
to die. People throw away their lives for honor, love, or friendship, and only
then do they turn into spirits. But when you talk about

living

spirits-well,

that's a different story. They always seem to be motivated by evil."
I mull this over.
"But like you said, there might be examples, " Oshima continues, " of
people becoming living spirits out of positive feelings of love. I just haven't
done much research into the matter, I'm afraid. Maybe it happens. Love can
rebuild the world, they say, so everything's possible when it comes to love. "
"Have you ever been in love?" I ask.
He stares at me, taken aback. "What do you think? I'm not a starfish or a
pepper tree. I'm a living, breathing human being. Of course I've been in love."
"That isn't what I mean, " I say, blushing.
"I know, " he says, and smiles at me gently.

Once Oshima leaves I go back to my room, switch the stereo to 45 rpm, lower
the needle, and listen to " Kafka on the Shore, " following the lyrics on the
jacket.

You sit at the edge of the world,
I am in a crater that's no more.
Words without letters
Standing in the shadow of the door.
The moon shines down on a sleeping lizard,
Little fish rain down from the sky.
Outside the window there are soldiers,
steeling themselves to die.
(Refrain)
Kafka sits in a chair by the shore,
Thinking of the pendulum that moves the world, it seems.
When your heart is closed,
The shadow of the unmoving Sphinx,
Becomes a knife that pierces your dreams.
The drowning girl's fingers
Search for the entrance stone, and more.
Lifting the hem of her azure dress,
She gazes at Kafka on the shore.
I listen to the record three times. First of all, I'm wondering how a record
with lyrics like this could sell over a million copies. I'm not saying they're
totally obscure, just kind of abstract and surreal. Not exactly catchy lyrics. But
if you listen to them a few times they begin to sound familiar. One by one the
words find a home in my heart. It's a weird feeling. Images beyond any mean­
ing arise like cutout figures and stand alone, just like when I'm in the middle
of a deep dream.
The melody is beautiful, simple but different, too. And Miss Saeki's voice
melts into it naturally. Her voice needs more power-she isn't what you'd call
a professional singer-but it gently cleanses your mind, like a spring rain
washing over stepping stones in a garden. She played the piano and sang,
then they added a small string section and an oboe. The recording budget
must have kept the arrangement simple, but actually it's this simplicity that
gives the song its appeal.
Two unusual chords appear in the refrain. The other chords in the song

210

are nothing special, but these two are different, not the kind you can figure
out by listening just a couple of times. At first I felt confused. To exaggerate a
little, I felt betrayed, even. The total unexpectedness of the sounds shook me,
unsettled me, like when a cold wind suddenly blows in through a crack. But
once the refrain is over, that beautiful melody returns, taking you back to that
original world of harmony and intimacy. No more chilly wind here. The
piano plays its final note while the strings quietly hold the last chord, the lin­
gering sound of the oboe bringing the song to a close.
Listening to it over and over, I start to get some idea why " Kafka on the
Shore " moved so many people. The song's direct and gentle at the same time,
the product of a capable yet unselfish heart. There's a kind of miraculous feel
to it, this overlap of opposites. A shy nineteen-year-old girl from a provincial
town writes lyrics about her boyfriend far away, sits down at the piano and sets
it to music, then unhesitantly sings her creation. She didn't write the song for
others to hear, but for herself, to warm her own heart, if even a little. And her
self-absorption strikes a subtle but powerful chord in her listeners' hearts.
I throw together a simple dinner from things in the fridge, then put
" Kafka on the Shore " on the turntable again. Eyes closed, I sit in the chair
and try to picture the nineteen-year-old Miss Saeki in the studio, playing the
piano and singing. I think about the love she felt as she sang. And how mind­
less violence severed that love forever.
The record is over, the needle lifts up and returns to its cradle.

Miss Saeki may have written the lyrics to " Kafka on the Shore " in this very
room. The more I listen to the record, the more I'm sure that this Kafka on
the shore is the young boy in the painting on the wall. I sit at the desk and,
like she did last night, hold my chin in my hands and gaze at the same angle
at the painting right in front of me. I'm positive now, this had to be where she
wrote it. I see her gazing at the painting, remembering the young boy, writing
the poem she then set to music. It had to have been at night, when it was
pitch-dark outside.
I stand up, go over to the wall, and examine the painting up close. The
young man is looking off in the distance, his eyes full of a mysterious depth.
In one corner of the sky there are some sharply outlined clouds, and the
largest sort of looks like a crouching Sphinx.
I search my memory. The Sphinx was the enemy Oedipus defeated by
solving the riddle, and once the monster knew it had lost, it leaped off a cliff
and killed itself. Thanks to this exploit, Oedipus got to be king of Thebes and

211

ended up marrying his own mother. And the name Kafka. I suspect Miss
Saeki used it since in her mind the mysterious solitude of the boy in the pic­
ture overlapped with Kafka's fictional world. That would explain the title: a
solitary soul straying by an absurd shore.
Other lines overlap with things that happened to me. The part about
"little fish rain from the sky " -isn't that exactly what happened in that shop­
ping area back home, when hundreds of sardines and mackerel rained down?
The part about how the shadow "becomes a knife that pierces your
dreams " -that could be my father's stabbing. I copy down all the lines of
the song in my notebook and study them, underlining parts that particularly
interest me. But in the end it's all too suggestive, and I don't know what to
make of it.

Words without letters

What could it mean? Were all these just coincidences? I walk to the win­
dow and look out at the garden. Darkness is just settling in on the world. I go
over to the reading room, sit on the sofa, and open up Tanizaki's translation of

The Tale of Genii. At ten I go to bed, turn off the bedside light,

and close my

eyes, waiting for the fifteen-year-old Miss Saeki to return to this room.

Chapter 24

I

t was already eight p.m. when their bus from Kobe arrived in front of
Tokushima Station.
"Well,Mr. Nakata,here we are. Shikoku. "
"What a wonderful bridge. Nakata's never seen such a huge one before. "
The two of them alighted from the bus and sat down on a bench at the

station to survey their surroundings.
"So-did you have a message from God or something?" Hoshino asked.
"Telling you where you're supposed to go now? What you're supposed to do?"
"No. Nakata still has no idea."
"Great . . . "
Nakata rubbed his head deliberately with his palm for a while,as if pon­
dering weighty matters. "Mr. Hoshino?" he finally said.
"What's up?"
'Tm sorry,but Nakata really needs to go to sleep.I'm so sleepy I feel like
I could fall asleep right here. "
"Wait a sec-you can't fall asleep here," Hoshino said, flustered. "Tell
you what, I'll find a place where you can sack out, okay? Just hang in there
for a while. "
"All right. Nakata will hang in there and try not to go to sleep. "
"Good. Are you hungry?"
"No, just sleepy. "
Hoshino quickly located the tourist information counter,found an inex­
pensive inn that included complimentary breakfast, and called to book a
room. It was some distance from the station,so they hailed a cab. As soon as
they arrived, Hoshino asked the maid to lay out their futons for them.
Nakata skipped taking a bath and undressed,lay down in bed,and in an
instant was peacefully snoring away. 'Til probably sleep for a long time, so
don't be alarmed," he said just before he fell asleep.

"Hey, I'm not going to bother you-sleep as much as you want, " Hoshino
said, but Nakata was already lost to the world.
Hoshino enjoyed a leisurely bath, went out, and strolled around to get
the lay of the land, then ducked inside a sushi shop for dinner and a beer. He
wasn't much of a drinker, and a medium-size bottle of beer was enough to
turn his face bright red and put him in a good mood. After dinner he played
pachinko and lost twenty-five dollars in a hour. His Chunichi Dragons base­
ball cap drew a few stares from passersby, and he decided he must be the only
one in Tokushima wearing one.
Back at the inn he found Nakata just as he'd left him, sound asleep. The
light was on in the room, but that obviously didn't seem to bother him. What
an easygoing old guy, Hoshino concluded. He took off his cap, his aloha shirt,
and his jeans, then crawled into bed and turned out the light. But he felt
worked up, and the combination of this and his new surroundings kept him
from falling asleep. Jeez, he thought, maybe I should've found a hooker and
got laid. But as he listened to Nakata's tranquil, regular breathing, he was sud­
denly embarrassed by the thought, though he wasn't sure why.
Staring at the ceiling in the dark, lying in bed in a cheap inn in a town
he'd never been to before next to a strange old guy he knew nothing about, he
began to have doubts about himself. By this time of night he should've been
driving back to Tokyo, now somewhere around Nagoya. He didn't dislike his
job, and there was a girl in Tokyo who always made time for him if he wanted
to see her. Still, on an impulse, as soon as he'd unloaded his cargo of furniture
in Kobe, he'd called another driver he knew in town and asked him to take
his place and drive his rig back to Tokyo. He phoned his company and man­
aged to wrangle three days off, and then it was off to Shikoku with Nakata. All
he had along was a small bag with a shaving kit and a change of clothes.
Hoshino originally was intrigued by the resemblance between the old
man and his late grandfather, but that impression had faded, and now he was
more curious about Nakata himself. The things the old guy talked about, and
even how he talked, were definitely strange, but in an interesting way. He had
to find out where the old man was going, and what he'd end up doing when
he got there.

Hoshino was born into a farming family, the third of five sons. Up until junior
high he was well behaved, but after entering a trade school he fell in with a
bad crowd and started getting in trouble. The police hauled him in a few
times. He was able to graduate but couldn't find a decent job-and trouble

with a girl only compounded his difficulties-so he decided to join the Self­
Defense Force. Though he was hoping to be a tank driver, he didn't make the
cut and spent most of his time driving large transport trucks. After three years
in the SDF he got out and found a job with a trucking company, and for the
last six years he'd been driving for a living.
This suited him. He'd always loved machines, and when he was perched
high lip in the cab with his hands on the wheel, it was like he was in his own
private little kingdom. The job's long hard hours were tiring, but he knew he
couldn't stand a regular company job, commuting to a dingy office every
morning only to have a boss watch his every move like a hawk.
He'd always been the feisty type who got into fights. He was skinny and
on the short side, not very tough looking, but in his case looks were deceiving.
He was deceptively strong, and once he reached the breaking point a crazed
look would come over him that sent most opponents scurrying for cover.
He'd gotten into a lot of fights, both as a soldier and as a truck driver, but only
recently had started to understand that this, win or lose, never accomplished
very much. At least, he thought proudly, he'd never had any serious injuries.
During his wild high school days, his grandfather was always the one
who'd show lip at the local precinct, bowing apologetically to the police, and
they'd release Hoshino into his custody. They always stopped at a restaurant
on the way home, his grandfather treating him to a delicious meal. He never
lectured Hoshino, even then. Not once did his parents come to get him.
They were just barely scraping by and didn't have the time or energy to worry
about their no-good third son. Hoshino sometimes wondered what would've
happened to him if his grandfather hadn't been there to bail him out. The
old man, at least, knew he was alive and worried about him.
Despite all this, he'd never once thanked his grandfather for all he'd
done. He didn't know what to say, and was also too preoccupied trying to
get by. His grandfather died of cancer soon after Hoshino joined the Self­
Defense Force. At the end he got senile and didn't even recognize him.
Hoshino hadn't been back home once since the old man passed away.

When Hoshino woke up at eight the next morning, Nakata was still fast
asleep and looked like he hadn't budged an inch all night. The volume and
pace of his breathing, too, was unchanged. Hoshino went downstairs and ate
breakfast with the other guests. A pretty bare-bones meal, though there were
unlimited seconds on miso soup and rice.
" Will your companion be eating breakfast?" the maid called out.

215

"He's still out cold. Looks like he won't be needing breakfast. If you don't
mind, could you not put away the futon for a while?"
At noon, with Nakata still fast asleep, Hoshino arranged for them to
stay one more night. He went out to a saba place and had chicken and egg
over rice. Afterward he strolled around for a while and wound up in a coffee
shop, where he had a cup and a smoke and flipped through a few of the
comic books.
When he got back to the inn, just before two, he found Nakata still
hadn't woken up. Concerned, he felt the old man's forehead, but he didn't
seem to have a fever. His breathing was calm and regular, and his cheeks had
a healthy glow to them. He seemed perfectly fine. All he was doing was sleep­
ing soundly, without ever even turning over in bed.
"Is he all right, sleeping this much?" the maid said when she looked in
on them. "Maybe he's ill?"
"He's exhausted, " Hoshino explained. "Let's just let him sleep as much as
he wants. "
"Okay, but I've never seen anybody sleep so much before. . . . "
Dinnertime came and the sleep marathon continued. Hoshino went out
to a curry restaurant and had an extra-large order of beef curry and a salad.
After this he went to the same pachinko place as the night before and again
played for an hour. This time, though, his luck changed, and for under ten
dollars he won two cartons of Marlboros. It was nine-thirty by the time he got
back to the inn with his winnings, and he couldn't believe his eyes-Nakata
was still asleep.
Hoshino added up the hours. The old man had been sleeping for over
twenty-four hours. Sure, he said he'd sleep a long time, so not to worry, but
this was ridiculous! Hoshino felt uncharacteristically helpless. Suppose the
old guy never woke lip? What the hell was he supposed to do then?
"Cripes, " he said, and shook his head.

But the next morning, when Hoshino woke up at seven, Nakata was already
awake, gazing out the window.
"Hey, Cramps, so you finally made it up, huh?" Hoshino said, relieved.
"Yes, Nakata just woke lip. I don't know how long I slept, but it must have
been a long time. I feel like a new man. "
"No kidding it was a long time! You went to sleep at nine p.m. the day
before yesterday, so you've been asleep something like thirty-four hours.
You're a regular Snow White. "

216

"Nakata's kind of hungry. "
"I bet you are. You haven't had a bite in two days. "
The two of them went downstairs to the dining room and had breakfast.
Nakata amazed the maid at how much rice he packed away.
"You're as big an eater as you are a sleeper!" she exclaimed. "It's like two
days' worth of meals in one sitting!"
"Yes, I have to eat a lot now. "
"You're a really healthy person, aren't you?"
"Yes, Nakata is. I can't read, but I've never had a single cavity and don't
need glasses. I never have to go to the doctor, either. My shoulders never get
stiff, and I take a good dump every morning. "
"Isn't that something, " the maid said, impressed. "By the way, what's on
your schedule for today?"
"We're headed west," Nakata declared.
"West, " she mused. "That must mean you're going toward Takamatsu. "
''I'm not so bright and don't know geography. "
"Anyway, Cramps, why don't we go over to Takamatsu?" Hoshino
chimed in. "We can figure out what's next after we get there. "
"All right. Let's go to Takamatsu, then. We'll figure out what's next after
we get there. "
"Sort of a unique style of traveling, I must say, " the maid commented.
"You got that right, " Hoshino said.

Back in their room, Nakata went to the toilet, while Hoshino, still in his
yukata robe, lay back on the tatami and watched the news on TV. Not much
was happening. Police still didn't have any leads in the murder of a famous
sculptor in Nakano-no clues, no witnesses. The police were searching for
the man's fifteen-year-old son, who'd disappeared shortly before the murder.
Man alive, Hoshino thought, a fifteen-year-old kid. Why is it that these
days it's always fifteen-year-olds who're involved in all these violent incidents?
Of course when he was fifteen himself, he stole a motorcycle from a parking
lot and went for a joyride-without, mind you, a license-so he had no right
to complain. Not that you could compare borrowing a motorcycle and slicing
your dad into sashimi. It was only luck, maybe, that had kept him from stab­
bing his own father, because he'd certainly taken his share of beatings.
The news was just winding up when Nakata emerged from the bath­
room. "Mr. Hoshino, may I ask you something?"
"What's up?"

217

"Does your back hurt at all?"
"Yeah, it's an occupational hazard, I guess. Every trucker I know has back
problems, just like pitchers all have sore shoulders. Why do you ask?"
"When I saw your back I thought maybe you had that problem."
"Huh . . . "
"Do you mind if Nakata touches your back?"
"Be my guest."
Hoshino lay facedown and Nakata straddled him. He put his hands just
above the backbone and held them there. All the while Hoshino was watch­
ing some afternoon talk show featuring all the latest celebrity gossip. A
famous actress had just gotten engaged to a not-sa-famous young novelist.
Hoshino didn't care, but there wasn't anything else on. Apparently the
actress's income was ten times that of the novelist, who wasn't even partiClI­
larly handsome or very intelligent looking.
Hoshino found the whole thing suspect. "That marriage won't work out,
I can tell you that. There's gotta be some kind of misunderstanding going
on here."
"Mr. Hoshino, your bones are out of line a bit."
"Not surprising, what with the out-of-line kind of life I've led, " Hoshino
replied, and yawned.
"It's going to cause all sorts of problems if you don't do something
about it."
"You think?"
"You'll get headaches, you won't be able to take a good dump. And then
your back will go out on you."
"That can't be good."
'This will hurt a little. Do you mind?"
"No, go right ahead."
"Honestly speaking, it's going to hurt a lot."
"Look, Cramps, I've been punched out my whole life-at home, at
school, in the SDF -but I survived. Not to brag or anything, but the days I
haven't been hit I could count on both hands. So I'm not worried that some­
thing might hurt a little. Hot or tickly, sweet or spicy-bring it on."
Nakata squinted, concentrating, carefully making sure he had his
thumbs just where he wanted them. Once they were positioned just right, he
ever so slowly increased the pressure, gauging Hoshino's reaction. He
breathed in deeply, then let out a clipped cry like some winter bird's squawk,
and pressed down with all his might on the area between muscle and back­
bone. The pain Hoshino felt at that instant was awful, unreasonably so. A

218

huge flash of light went off in his brain and everything went white. He
stopped breathing. It felt like he'd been thrown from the top of a tall tower
into the depths of hell. He couldn't even manage a scream, so hideous was
the pain. All thoughts had burned up and shot away. It was like his body had
been shattered into pieces. Even death couldn't be this awful, he felt. He
tried to open his eyes but couldn't. He just lay there, helpless, facedown on
the tatami, drooling, tears streaming down his face. He must have endured
this for some thirty seconds or so.
Finally he was able to breathe again, and he staggered as he sat up. The
tatami wavered before him like the sea in a storm.
'Tm sure it was painful."
Hoshino shook his head a few times, as if checking to see that he was still
alive. "Pain doesn't begin to describe it. Imagine getting skinned alive, skew­
ered, ground down, then run over by an angry herd of bulls. What the hell
did you

do to me?"

"I put your bones back in the right position. You should be fine for
the time being. Your back won't ache. And I guarantee you'll take good
dumps."
As predicted, when the pain receded, like the tide going out, his back did
feel better. The usual heavy, sluggish feeling had vanished. The area around
his temples felt much better, and he could breathe more easily. And sure
enough, he felt like going to the john.
"Yeah, I guess certain parts do feel better."
"The problem was all in the spine, " Nakata said.
"But damn did that hurt, " Hoshino said, and sighed.

The two of them took the JR express train from Tokushima Station bound for
Takamatsu. Hoshino paid for everything, the inn and the train fare. Nakata
insisted on paying his share, but Hoshino wouldn't hear of it.
'Til pay now, and we can settle up later. I don't like it when men go all to
pieces over money, okay?"
"All right. Nakata doesn't understand money very well, so I'll do as you
say, " Nakata said.
"I gotta tell you, though, I feel great, thanks to that shiatsu you did on me.
So at least let me pay you back for it, okay? I haven't felt this good in I don't
know how long. I feel like a new man."
"That's wonderful. Nakata doesn't know what shiatsu means, but I do
know how important the bones are."

'Tm not sure what you call it either-shiatsu, bone-setting, chiroprac­
tic - but whatever it is, you've really got a talent for it. You could make a lot
of money doing this. You could make a bundle just doing all my trucker
buddies. "
"As soon as I saw your back I could tell the bones were out of line. When
I see something out of line I like to set it right. I made furniture for a long
time and whenever I saw something crooked I just had to straighten it out.
That's just how Nakata is. But this was the first time I straightened out bones. "
"I guess you're a natural, " Hoshino said, impressed.
"Nakata used to be able to speak with cats. "
"No kidding?"
"But not so long ago I couldn't talk with them anymore. It must be John­
nie Walker's fault. "
"I see,"
"I'm stupid, so I don't understand difficult things. And there have been so
many difficult things happening lately. Fish and leeches falling from the sky,
for instance. "
"Really?"
"But I'm glad I could make your back better. If you feel good, then
Nakata feels good. "
''I'm really happy, too, " Hoshino said.
"That's good. "
"Now that you mention those leeches . . . "
"Yes, Nakata remembers that very well. "
"Did you have something to do with that?"
Nakata thought about it for a while, a rare occurrence. "I don't really
know myself. All I know is when I opened my umbrella it started to rain
leeches. "
"What'ya know. . . . "
'The worst thing of all is killing other people, " Nakata said, and gave a
decisive nod.
"Absolutely. Killing is bad, for sure. "
"That's right, " Nakata said again, nodding forcefully.

The two of them got out at Takamatsu Station, then slipped inside a noodle
place near the station and had udon for lunch. Outside the restaurant win­
dow there were several large cranes on the docks, covered with seagulls.

2 20

Nakata methodically enjoyed each and every noodle. "This udon is deli­
cious," he said.
"Glad you like it," Hoshino said. "So, what do you think? Is this spot
okay?"
"Yes, Nakata thinks it will do."
"So we got the right spot picked out. Now what are you going to do?"
"I've got to find the entrance stone. "

"Entrance stone?"
"That's right."
"Hmm," Hoshino said. "I bet there's a long story behind that. "
Nakata tilted his bowl and drained the last drop of soup. "Yes, it is a long
story. But it's so long I don't understand it myself. Once we get there, though,
Nakata thinks we'll understand."
"As usual, you gotta be there to get it?"
"Yes, that's right. "
"Until we go there I won't understand it."
"Yes. Until we go there

I won't understand it either. "

"Enough already. I don't like long stories. Anyway, I guess we need to
find this

entrance stone thing. "

"That is correct," Nakata said.
"So where is it?"
"Nakata has no idea."
"Like I had to ask," Hoshino said, shaking his head.

Chapter 25

I

fall asleep for a short time, wake up, fall asleep again, wake up, over and
over. I don't want to miss the moment she appears. But I do miss it-I
look up and she's already seated at the desk, just like last night. The clock

next to my bed shows a little past three. I'm positive I closed the curtains
before going to bed, but again they're wide open. But there's no moon
tonight-that's the only difference. There's a heavy cloud cover, and it might
be drizzling outside. The room's much darker than last night, with only dis­
tant lamps in the garden casting a faint light between the trees. It takes a
while for my eyes to adjust.
The girl is seated at the desk, head in her hands, gazing at the painting.
She's wearing the same clothes as last night. Even if I squint and look hard,
this time it's too dark to make out her face. Strangely enough, though, her
body and silhouette stand out, floating there clearly in the darkness. The girl
is Miss Saeki when she was young-I have absolutely no doubt about it.
She looks deep in thought.Or in the midst of a long, deep dream. Check
that-maybe she herself

is Miss Saeki's long, deep dream. At any rate, I try to

breathe very quietly so as not to disturb the balance of this scene before me. I
don't move an inch, just glance occasionally at the clock to check the time.
Time passes slowly, regularly.
Out of the blue my heart starts beating hard, a dry sound like somebody's
knocking at the door. The sound echoes through the silent, dead-of-night
room, and startles me so much that I nearly leap right out of bed.
The girl's black silhouette moves ever so slightly. She looks up and listens
in the dark. She's heard it-the sound of my heart. She tilts her head just a
fraction, for all the world like an animal in the woods focusing on an unex­
pected, unknown sound. Then she turns to face me in bed. But I don't regis­
ter in her eyes, I can tell. I'm not in her dream. She and I are in two separate
worlds, divided by an invisible boundary.
Just as quickly as it came on, my pounding heart settles back down to

222

normal. And so does my breathing. I'm back to being invisible, and she's no
longer listening. Her gaze falls back on

like before, her heart is drawn once more toward the boy in that summer
scene.
She's there for about twenty minutes, then vanishes. Just like last night,
she stands up, barefoot, noiselessly glides toward the door, and, without open­
ing it, disappears outside. I sit still for a while, then finally get up. Keeping the
light off, I go over in the darkness and sit down on the seat she just occupied.
I rest both hands on the desk and absorb the afterglow of her presence. I close
my eyes, scooping up her shivering heart, letting it seep inside mine. I keep
my eyes closed.
There's one thing, I discover, the girl and I have in common. We're both
in love with someone who's no longer of this world.
A short time later I fall into a restless sleep. My body needs rest, but my
mind won't allow it. I swing like a pendulum, back and forth between the
two. Later, though-I'm not even sure if it's light out or not-birds begin
making a racket in the garden, and their voices pull me completely awake.

I tug on jeans and pull a long-sleeved shirt over my T-shirt and go outside. It's
after five o'clock and nobody else is up. I walk out of the old-looking town,
through the pine forest set up as a windbreak, past the seawall and out onto
the beach. There's barely a breeze against my skin. The sky's covered with a
layer of gray clouds, but it doesn't look like it's going to rain anytime soon. It's
a quiet, still morning. Like a layer of soundproofing, the clouds absorb every
sound the earth sends up.
I walk for a while on a path that parallels the sea, picturing the boy in the
painting walking the same path, canvas chair in hand, sitting

011

the shore.

I'm not sure, though, what scene along this shore the painting depicts. The
painting only shows the beach, the horizon, sky, and clouds. And an island.
But there are a number of islands along the shore, and I can't exactly recall
what the one in the painting looked like. I sit down on the sand, face the sea,
and make a kind of picture frame with my hands. I imagine the boy sitting
there. A single white seagull flits aimlessly across the windless sky. Small
waves break against the shore at regular intervals, leaving behind a gentle
curve and tiny bubbles on the sand.
All of a sudden I realize - I'm jealous of the boy in the painting.
"You're jealous of the boy in the painting, " the boy called Crow whispers
111

my ear.

2 23

You're jealous of that pitiful, twenty-year-old boy mistaken for some­
one else and pointlessly murdered-what is it, thirty years ago? So
insanely jealous it hurts. This is the first time you've ever been jealous in
your life. Now you finally understand what it feels like. It's like a brush fire
torching your heart.
You've never ever in your life envied anybody else, or ever wanted to be
someone else-but right now you do. You want more than anything to be
that boy. Even knowing that at age twenty he was going to be smashed over
the head with an iron pipe and beaten to death, you'd still trade places
with him. You'd do it, to be able to love Miss Saeki for those five years. And
to have her love you with all her heart. To hold her as much as you want,
to make love to her over and over. To let your fingers run over every single
part of her body, and let her do the same to you. And after you die, your
love will become a story etched forever in her heart. Every single night
she'll love you in her memory.
Yup, you're in a strange position, all right. You're in love with a girl
who is no more, jealous of a boy who's gone forever. Even so, this emotion
you're feeling is more real, and more intensely painful, than anything
you've ever felt before. And there's no way out. No possibility of finding an
exit. You've wandered into a labyrinth of time, and the biggest problem of
all is that you have no desire at all to get out. Am I right?

Oshima comes in a little later than yesterday. Before he does I vacuum the
first and second floors, wipe down all the desks and chairs, open the windows
and clean them, wash out the restroom, throw out the garbage, pour fresh
water in the vases. Then I turn on all the lights and switch on the catalog
computers. All that's left is to open the front gate.
Oshima checks my work and gives a satisfied nod. "You learn pretty
quick, and don't fool around, do you?"
I boil some water and make him some coffee. Like yesterday, I have a cup
of Earl Grey. It's started raining outside, pretty heavily. You can hear thunder
off in the distance. It's not yet noon, but it's like evening it's so dark.
"Oshima, I have something I'd like you to do for me. "
"What's that?"
"Can YOll get hold of the sheet music for 'Kafka on the Shore' some­
where?"
Oshima thinks it over. "As long as it's on a music publisher's website, I
imagine you could download it for a fee. I'll check it out and let you know. "

"Thanks."
He sits down on a corner of the counter, puts the tiniest lump of sugar
into his coffee cup, then carefully stirs it with a spoon. "So you like the song?"
"Yeah, a lot."
'Tm fond of it myself. It's a lovely tune, quite unique. Simple yet deep.
It tells you a lot about the person who composed it."
"The lyrics, though, are pretty symbolic, " I venture.
"From time immemorial, symbolism and poetry have been inseparable.
Like a pirate and his rum. "
"Do you think Miss Saeki knew what all the lyrics mean?"
Oshima looks up, listening to the thunder as if calculating how far away
it is. He turns to me and shakes his head. "Not necessarily. Symbolism and
meaning are two separate things. I think she found the right words by bypass­
ing procedures like meaning and logic. She captured words in a dream, like
delicately catching hold of a butterfly's wings as it flutters around. Artists are
those who can evade the verbose."
"So you're saying Miss Saeki maybe found those words in some other
space-like in dreams?"
"Most great poetry is like that. If the words can't create a prophetic
tunnel connecting them to the reader, then the whole thing no longer func­
tions as a poem."
"But plenty of poems only pretend to do that."
"Right. It's a kind of trick, and as long as you know that it isn't hard. As
long as you use some symbolic-sounding words, the whole thing looks like a
poem of sorts."
"In 'Kafka on the Shore' I feel something urgent and serious."
"Me too, " Oshima says. "The words aren't just something on the surface.
But the words and melody are so inseparable in my mind, I can't look at the
lyrics as pure poetry and decide how persuasive they are by themselves." He
shakes his head slightly. "At any rate, she was definitely blessed with a natural
talent, and had a real sense for music. She was also practical enough to grab
an opportunity when it came along. If that terrible incident hadn't taken her
out of circulation, I'm sure she would've developed her talent even further.
In any number of ways it's a real shame. . . ."
"So where did all that talent go?"
Oshima looks at me. "You're asking where Miss Saeki's talent went after
her boyfriend died?"
I nod. "If talent's a kind of natural energy, doesn't it have to find an
outlet?"

" I don't know, " he replies. " Nobody can predict where talent's headed.
Sometimes it simply vanishes. Other times it sinks down under the earth like
an underground stream and flows off who knows where."
" Maybe Miss Saeki focused her talents somewhere else, other than
music, " I venture.
" Somewhere else?" Oshima, obviously interested, narrows his brow.
" What do you mean?"
I'm at a loss for words. " I don't know. . . . I just feel maybe that's what
happened. Maybe into something intangible."
" Intangible?"
" Something other people can't see, something you pursue for yourself.
An inner process."
Oshima brushes his hair off his forehead, locks of it spilling between his
slender fingers. " That's an interesting idea. For all we know, after Miss Saeki
came back to town maybe she used her talents somewhere out of sight­
as you said, for something

intangible.

But you have to remember she disap­

peared for about twenty-five years, so unless you ask her yourself there's no
way of knowing for sure."
I hesitate, then decide to just go ahead. " Can I ask you something really
stupid?"
" Really stupid?"
I blush. " Totally off the wall."
" No problem. I don't necessarily mind stupid, off-the-wall things."
" I can't believe I'm actually saying this to somebody."
Oshima tilts his head ever so slightly, waiting for me to go on.
" Is it possible that Miss Saeki . . . is my mother?"
Oshima leans back against the counter, taking time to search for the right
words. The clock on the wall ticks away as I wait.
Finally he speaks up. " So what you're saying is that when she was twenty,
Miss Saeki left Takamatsu in despair and was living alone someplace when
she happened to meet your father, Koichi Tamura, and they got married.
They were blessed with you and then, four years later, something happened
and she ran away, leaving you behind. After this there's a mysterious blank,
but then she shows up back in Shikoku. Do I have that right?"
"Yeah."
" It's not impossible. What I mean is, at this point I don't have any evi­
dence to refute your hypothesis. So much of her life is a total mystery. Rumor
has it she lived in Tokyo. Plus she's about the same age as your father. When

she came back to Takamatsu, though, she was alone. How old did you say
your sister is?"
"Twenty-one."
"The same age as me, " Oshima says.

''I'm

not your sister-that much I

know for certain. I've got parents, and my brother - all related by blood. A
family way too good for me." He folds his arms and looks me at for a while.
''I've got a question for you. Have you ever looked at your family register?
That would give your mother's name and age."
"Of course I have."
"So what did it say?"
"There wasn't any name, " I say.
He looks surprised. "No

name?

How can that be?"

"There wasn't any. No kidding. I have no idea why. As far as the family
register's concerned, I don't have a mother. Or an older sister. There's just
my father's name and mine on the register. Legally, I'm a bastard. An illegiti­
mate child."
"But you actually had a mother and a sister at one time."
I nod. "I did, until I was four. The four of us lived together. It's not just my
imagination. I remember it very clearly. The two of them left soon after I
turned four." I pull out my wallet and show Oshima the photo of me and my sis­
ter playing at the shore. He gazes at it for a moment, smiles, and hands it back.
" 'Kafka on the Shore,' " he says.
I nod and put the photograph back in my wallet. The wind swirls outside,
pounding rain against the window. The ceiling light casts a shadow of me and
Oshima on the floor, where we look like we're having an ominous talk in
some alternate world.
"You don't remember your mother's face?" Oshima asks. "You lived
together till you were four, so you should have some memory of what she
looked like."
I shake my head. "I just can't recall, not at all. I don't know why, but the
part of my memory where her face should be is dark, painted over, blank. "
Oshima ponders this for a while. ''Tell me more about why you think
Miss Saeki might be your mother."
''That's enough, " I say. "Let's just forget it. I'm making too much of it."
"It's all right-go ahead and say what's on your mind," he says. "Then the
two of us can decide if you're making too much of it or not."
Oshima's shadow on the floor moves in time with his movements,
though it's slightly more exaggerated.

"There are an amazing amount of coincidences between me and Miss
Saeki, " I say. "They're like pieces of a puzzle that fit together. I understood
this when I listened to 'Kafka on the Shore.' First off is the fact that I was
drawn to this library, like fate reeling me in. A straight line from Nakano to
Takamatsu. Very strange, when you think about it."
"Like the plot of a Greek tragedy, " Oshima comments.
"Plus, " I add, 'Tm in love with her."
"With Miss Saeki?"
"Yeah, probably."

"Probably?"

Oshima repeats, frowning. "Do you mean it's

probably

Miss

Saeki you're in love with? Or that you're probably in love with her?"
I turn red. "I can't really explain it, " I reply. "It's complicated and there's
a lot of stuff I still don't get."
"But you're probably in love, probably with Miss Saeki?"
"Right, " I say. "Very much."

"Probably,

but also very much."

I nod.
"At the same time it's possible she's your mother?"
Another of my patented nods.
"For a fifteen-year-old who doesn't even shave yet, you're sure carrying a
lot of baggage around." Oshima takes a sip of his coffee and carefully places
the cup back on its saucer. 'Tm not saying that's wrong. Just that everything
has a critical point."
I don't say anything.
Oshima touches his temples and is lost in thought for a time. He crosses
his slim fingers together in front of his chest. 'Til try to find that sheet music
as soon as I can. I can finish up here, so why don't you go back to your room."

At lunchtime I take over from Oshima at the front counter. There are fewer
visitors than usual, probably due to the steady rain. When he comes back
from his break, he hands me a large envelope with a computer printout of the
sheet music for "Kafka on the Shore."
"Convenient world we live in, " he says.
"Thanks, " I tell him.
"If you don't mind, why don't you take a cup of coffee upstairs. No cream
or sugar. You make really good coffee."
I make a fresh cup and take it on a tray to the second floor. As always, the
door to Miss Saeki's room is open and she's at her desk, writing. When I put

2 28

the cup of coffee on her desk, she looks up at me and smiles, then puts the
cap back on her fountain pen and rests it on top of the paper.
" So, are you getting used to things around here?"
" Bit by bit, " I answer.
" Are you free now?"
"Yes, I am, " I tell her.
" Why don't you sit down, then." Miss Saeki points to the wooden chair
beside her desk. " Let's talk for a while."
It's starting to thunder again. Still far away, but gradually getting closer.
I do what she says and take a seat.
" How old are you again? Sixteen?"
" Fifteen. I just turned fifteen, " 1 respond.
"You ran away from home, didn't you?"
"Yes, 1 did."
" Was there some reason you had to do that?"
1 shake my head. What should I say?

Miss Saeki picks up the cup and takes a sip while she waits for my
answer.
" I felt like if I stayed there I'd be damaged beyond repair, " I say.
" Damaged?" Miss Saeki says, narrowing her eyes.
"Yes, " 1 say.
After a pause she says, " It sounds strange for a boy your age to use a word
like

damaged,

though I must say I'm intrigued. What exactly do you mean by

damaged?"
I search for the right words. First I look for the boy named Crow, but he's
nowhere to be found. I'm left to choose them on my own, and that takes time.
But Miss Saeki waits there patiently. Lightning flashes outside, and after a
time thunder booms far away.
" I mean I'd change into something I shouldn't."
Miss Saeki looks at me with great interest. " As long as there's such a thing
as time, everybody's damaged in the end, changed into something else. It
always happens, sooner or later."
" But even if that happens, you've got to have a place you can retrace your
steps to."
"A place you can retrace your steps to?"
"A place that's worth coming back to."
Miss Saeki stares straight at me.
I blush, then summon my courage and look up at her. She has on a navy
blue dress with short sleeves. She must have a whole closet of dresses in

different shades of blue. Her only accessories are a thin silver necklace and a
smallish wristwatch with a black leather band. I look for the fifteen-year-old
girl in her and find her right away. She's hidden, asleep, like a 3-D painting in
the forest of her heart. But if you look carefully you can spot her. My chest
starts pounding again, like somebody's hammering a long nail into the walls
surrounding it.
"For a fifteen-year-old, you make a lot of sense. "
I have no idea how to respond to that. So I don't say anything.
"When I was fifteen, " Miss Saeki says with a smile, "all I wanted was to go
off to some other world, a place beyond anybody's reach. A place beyond the
flow of time. "
"But there's no place like that in this world. "
"Exactly. Which is why I'm living here, in this world where things are
continually damaged, where the heart is fickle, where time flows past without
a break. " As if hinting at the flow of time, she's silent for a while. "But you
know, " she goes on, "when I was fifteen, I thought there had to be a place like
that in the world. I was sure that somewhere I'd

nm

across the entrance that

would take me to that other world. "
"Were you lonely when you were fifteen?"
"In a sense, I guess. I wasn't alone, but I was terribly lonely. Because I
knew that I would never be happier than I was then. That much I knew for
sure. That's why I wanted to go-just as I was-to some place where there
was

no time. "
"What I want is to grow up faster. "
Miss Saeki pulls back to study my expression. "You must be much

stronger and more independent than I am. At your age I was filled with illu­
sions of escaping reality, but you're standing right up to the real world and
confronting it head-on. That's a big difference. "
Strong and independent? I'm neither one. I'm just being pushed along
by reality, whether I like it or not. But I don't say anything.
"You know, you remind me of a fifteen-year-old boy I used to know a long
time ago. "
"Did he look like me?" I ask.
"You're taller and more muscular than he was, but there is a resem­
blance. He didn't enjoy talking with other kids his age-they were on a differ­
ent wavelength-so he spent most of his time holed up in his room, reading
or listening to music. He'd get the same frown lines, too, whenever the topic
got difficult. And you love to read as well. "
I nod.

Miss Saeki glances at her watch. " Thank you for the coffee."
Taking that as my signal to leave, I stand up and head for the door. Miss
Saeki picks up her black fountain pen, slowly twists off the cap, and goes back
to her writing. There's another flash of lightning outside, bathing the room
for an instant in a weird color. The clap of thunder hits a moment later. This
time it's closer than before.
" Kafka, " Miss Saeki says.
I stop at the doorway and turn around.
"I just remembered that I wrote a book on lightning once."
I don't say anything. A book on lightning?
" I went all over Japan interviewing people who'd survived lightning
strikes. It took me a few years. Most of the interviews were pretty interesting.
A small publisher put it out, but it barely sold. The book didn't come to any
conclusion, and nobody wants to read a book that doesn't have one. For me,
though, having no conclusion seemed perfectly fine."
A tiny hammer in my head is pounding on a drawer somewhere, persis­
tently. I'm trying to remember something, something very important-but I
don't know what it is. By this time Miss Saeki's gone back to her writing and
I go back to my room.

The rainstorm continues to batter us for another hour. The thunder is so
incredibly loud that I'm afraid the windows in the library will shatter. Every
time a bolt of lightning streaks across the sky, the stained-glass window on the
landing flashes an image like some ancient ghost on the white wall across
from it. By two o'clock, the storm lets up, and yellowish light begins to spill
out between the clouds like a reconciliation has finally been reached. Water
continues to drip down in the gentle sunlight.
When evening rolls around, I start closing up the place for the night.
Miss Saeki says good-bye to me and Oshima and heads home. I hear the
engine of her Golf and picture her seated at the wheel, turning the key. I tell
Oshima I'll finish locking up. Whistling some aria, he goes off to wash up
in the restroom, then leaves. I listen as the Mazda Miata roars off, the sound
fading off in the distance. Now the library's all mine. It's much quieter than
ever before.
I go to my room and study the sheet music for " Kafka on the Shore." Like
I suspected, most of the chords are simple. The refrain, though, has a couple
tricky ones. I go over to the reading room and try playing it on the upright
piano. The fingering's really tough, so I practice it over and over, trying to get

my hands around it, and somehow wind up getting it to sound right. At first
the chords sound all wrong. I'm sure it's a misprint, or that the piano's out of
tune. But the longer I listen to how those two chords sound one after the
other, the more I'm convinced the whole song hangs on them. These two
chords are what keep "Kafka on the Shore " from degrading into some silly
pop song, give it a special depth and substance. But how in the world did
Miss Saeki come up with them?
I go back to my room, boil water in the electric kettle, and make some
tea. I take out the old records we found in the storage room and put them on
the turntable one after another. Bob Dylan's
"White Album, "

Blonde on Blonde, the Beatles'
Otis Redding's Dock of the Bay, Stan Getz's Getz/Gilberto ­

all hit albums from the late sixties. That young boy-with Miss Saeki right
beside him-must've done what I was doing, putting the records on the turn­
table, lowering the needle, listening to the music coming out of these speak­
ers. The music felt like it was taking me and the whole room off to some
different time, a world before I was even born. As I enjoy the music, I review
the conversation we'd had that afternoon, trying to capture our exact words.
"When I was fifteen, I thought there had to be a place like that in the
world. I was sure that somewhere I'd run across the entrance that would take
me to that other world. "
I can hear her voice right beside me. Inside my head something knocks
at a door, a heavy, persistent knock.

An entrance?
I lift the needle off the Stan Getz album, pull out the single of "Kafka
on the Shore, " place it on the turntable, and lower the needle. And listen to
her sing.

The drowning girl's fingers
Search for the entrance stone, and more.
Lifting the hem of her azure dress,
She gazes at Kafka on the shore.
The girl who comes to this room most likely located that entrance stone.
She's in another world, just as she was at fifteen, and at night she comes to
visit this room. In her light blue dress, she comes to gaze at Kafka on the
shore.
Suddenly, completely out of nowhere, I remember my father talking
about how he'd once been struck by lightning. He didn't tell me himself-I'd

read about it in an interview in a magazine. When he was a student in art
college, he had a part-time job as a caddy at a golf course. One day he was fol­
lowing his golfer around the course when the sky suddenly changed color
and a huge thunderstorm crashed down on them. They took refuge under a
tree when it was hit by a bolt of lightning. This huge tree was split right in
two. The golfer he was caddying for was killed, but my father, sensing some­
thing, leaped away from the tree in time. He got some light burns, his hair
was singed, and the shock of the lightning threw him against a rock. He
struck his head and lost consciousness, but survived the ordeal with only a
small scar on his forehead. That's what I was trying to remember this after­
noon, standing there in Miss Saeki's doorway listening to the roar of the thun­
der. It was after he recovered from his injuries that my father got serious about
his career as a sculptor.
As Miss Saeki went around interviewing people for her book, maybe she
met my father. It's entirely possible. There can't be that many people around
who've been struck by lightning and lived, can there?
I breathe very quietly, waiting for the dawn. A cloud parts, and moonlight
shines down on the trees in the garden. There are just too many coinci­
dences. Everything seems to be speeding up, rushing toward one destination.

Chapter 26

I

t was already pretty late in the afternoon, and they had to find a place to
stay for the night. Hoshino went to the tourist information booth at Taka­
matsu Station and had them make a reservation at an inn. It was within

walking distance of the station, which was nice, but otherwise was typical and
somewhat dumpy. Neither Hoshino nor Nakata minded much, though. As
long as there were futons to sleep on, they were fine. As before, breakfast was
provided but they were on their own for dinner. This particularly suited
Nakata, who was likely to drop off to sleep any time.
Once they were in their room, Nakata had Hoshino lie facedown on the
futon, got on top of him again, and pressed down with both thumbs up and
down his lower back, carefully checking out the condition of his joints
and muscles. This time he was much more gentle, just tracing the spine and
checking out how tense the muscles were.
"Something wrong?" Hoshino asked anxiously.
"No, everything's fine. Nakata doesn't find anything wrong with you
now. Your spine's in good shape. "
"That's a relief, " Hoshino said. "I wasn't looking forward to another
torture session. "
"I know. Nakata's really sorry. But you did tell me you didn't mind pain,
so I went ahead and did it as hard as I could. "
"Yeah, I know that's what I said. But listen, Cramps, there

a re

limits.

Sometimes you've gotta use common sense. But I guess I shouldn't be com­
plaining-you did fix my back. But man alive, I never felt anything like that
in my life. The pain was unimaginable! It felt like you were ripping me apart.
Like I died and came back to life or something. "
"Nakata was dead for three weeks once. "
"No kidding, " Hoshino said. Still facedown, he took a gulp of tea and
munched on some crunchy snacks he'd picked up at a convenience store.
"So you really were dead?"

23 4

"I was."
"Where were you all that time? "
"Nakata doesn't remember. It felt like I was somewhere far away, doing
something else. But my head was floating and I can't remember anything.
Then I came back to this world and found out I was dumb. I couldn't read or
write anymore."
"You must've left your ability to read and write over on the other side."
"Maybe so."
The two of them were silent for a time. Hoshino decided it was best to
believe whatever the old man told him, no matter how eccentric it sounded.
At the same time he felt uneasy, as if pursuing this dead-for-three-weeks idea
any further would lead him into some chaotic, out-of-control situation. Better
to turn the conversation back to more practical matters. "So, now that we're
in Takamatsu, Mr. Nakata, where are you planning to go?"
"I have no idea, " Nakata replied. " I don't know what I'm supposed to do."
"What about that entrance stone?"
"That's right! Nakata completely forgot about it. We have to find the
stone. But I don't have a clue where to look. My mind's floating and won't
clear up. I wasn't too bright to begin with, and this kind of thing only makes
it worse."
"We're in a bit of a fix, then, aren't we?"
"Yes, I'd say we are."
"Not that sitting here staring at each other's all that much fun. This won't
get us anywhere."
"You're right."
"I think we should go around asking people, you know, if that stone's
somewhere around here."
"If you say so, then that's what Nakata wants to do. I'm pretty dumb, so
I'm used to asking people questions."
"My grandpa always said asking a question is embarrassing for a moment,
but not asking is embarrassing for a lifetime."
"I agree. When you die, everything you know disappears."
"Well, that's not what he meant, exactly, " Hoshino said, scratching his
head. "Anyway, do you have a mental image of the stone? What

kind of stone

it is, how big it is, its shape or color? What it's used for? If we don't have some
details, it's hard to ask. Nobody's going to know what the heck we're talking
about if we just say,

Is there an entrance stone anywhere around here? They'll

think we're nuts. You see what I mean?"
"Yes, I do. I might be dumb, but I'm not nuts."

235

"Okay. "
"The stone Nakata's looking for is very special. It's not so big. It's white,
and doesn't have any smell. I don't know what it's used for. It's round, sort
of like a rice cake. " He held up his hands to indicate something the size of an
LP record.
" Hmm. So if you spotted it, do you think you'd recognize it? You know,
like - Hey, here

it is."

" Nakata would know it right away. "
"There must be some kind of story or legend behind it. Maybe it's famous
and on display at a shrine or someplace. "
"It could be, I suppose. "
"Or maybe it's just in some house, and people use it as a weight when
they make pickles. "
" No,that's not possible. "
"Why not?"
"Because nobody can move the stone. "
" Nobody except you, you mean. "
"Yes, I think Nakata probably can. "
"After you move it,then what?"
Nakata did an uncharacteristic thing - he pondered this for a good long
time. At least he looked like he was,briskly rubbing his short,salt-and-pepper
hair. " I don't really know about that," he finally said. "All I know is it's about
time somebody moved it. "
Hoshino did some pondering himself. "And that somebody's you, right?
At least for now. "
"Yes," Nakata replied,"that's correct. "
"Is the stone found only in Takamatsu?"
" No,it isn't. It doesn't really matter where it is. It just happens to be here
right now. It would be much easier if it was in Nakano Ward. "
"But moving that kind of stone must be risky. "
"That's right. Maybe Nakata shouldn't bring this up,but it is very dangerous. "
" Damn," Hoshino said,slowly shaking his head. He put on his Chunichi
Dragons cap and pulled his ponytail out the hole in the back. 'This is starting
to feel like an Indiana Jones movie or something. "

The next morning they went to the tourist information booth in the station to
ask if there were any famous stones in Takamatsu or the vicinity.

" Stones?" the girl behind the counter said, frowning slightly. She'd been
trained to introduce all the usual tourist places, but nothing beyond that, and
the question clearly had her flustered . "What sort of stones are you look­
ing for?"
"A round stone about so big," Hoshino said, forming his hands i n a
circle the size of an LP, j ust as Nakata had done. "It's called the entrance
stone."
" 'Entrance stone'?"
"Yep. That's the name. It's pretty famous, I imagine."
"Entrance to what, though? "
"If I knew that I wouldn't have to go to all this trouble."
The girl thought about it for a wh ile. Hoshino gazed at her face the
whole time . Kind of pretty, he j udged, though her eyes are a bit too far apart,
giving her the look of a cautious bovine. She made a few calls, but it didn't
look l ike she was getting anywhere.
'Tm sorry," she finally sa id. "Nobody's heard of a stone by that name."
" Nobody?"
She shook her head . "Excuse me for asking, but are you here j ust to find
this stone?"
"Yeah, I don't know if it's just to see it. Anyway, I 'm from Nagoya . The old
guy's from Nakano Ward in Tokyo."
"Yes, Nakata's from Nakano Ward," Nakata chimed in. " I rode i n a lot of
trucks, and even got treated to eel once. I came this far and haven't spent a
cent of my own money."
"I see . . . ," the girl said.
"Not to worry. If nobody's heard about the stone, what're ya gonna do,
huh? It's not your fault. But maybe they call it something else. Are there any
other famous stones around here? You know, someth ing with a l egend
behind it, maybe? Or some stone people pray to? Anything l ike that?"
The girl looked timidly at Hoshino with her too-far-apart eyes, taking in
his Chunichi Dragons cap, his hair and ponytail, his green-tinted sunglasses,
pierced ear, and rayon aloha shirt. 'Td be happy to tell you how to get to the
city publi c library. You could research the stone there. I don't know much
about stones myself, I'm afraid."

The l ibrary, however, yielded nothing. There wasn't a si ngle book i n the
place devoted to stones in or around Takamatsu. The reference l ibrarian, say­
ing they might run across a reference somewhere, plunked down a stack of

books i n front of them: Legends of Kagawa Prefecture, Legends of Kobo Daishi
in Shikoku, A History of Takamatsu, and the like. S igh ing deeply, Hoshino
started leafing through them. For his part, Nakata carefully turned one page
after another in a photo collection entitled Famous Stones of Japan.
" I can't read," he said, "so this is the first l ibrary I 've ever been i n ."
'Tm not proud of it," Hosh ino said, "but this is a first for me, too . Even
though I can."
"It's kind of interesting now that we're here."
"Glad to hear it."
"There's a l ibrary in Nakano Ward. I think I'll stop by there every now
and then. The best thing is they don't charge anything. Nakata had no idea
they'd let you in if you can't read ."
'Tve got a cousin who was born blind, but he goes to see movies,"
Hoshino said . "What fun could that be?"
"I can see, but I 've never been to a movie theater."
"You're kidding! I'll have to take you sometime."
The l ibrarian came over and warned them to keep their voices down, so
they stopped talking and went back to their books. When he finished with
Famous Stones of Japan, Nakata put it back on the shelf and began fl ipping
through Cats ofthe World.
Grumbl ing all the while, Hoshino managed to look through all the
books piled up next to h i m . Unfortunately, he couldn't find any matches i n
any o f them. There were several references to the stone walls o f Takamatsu
Castle, but the stones in those walls were so massive that for Nakata to pick
one up was out of the question. There was also a promising legend about
Kobo Daishi , a famous scholarly monk of the Heian period . It was claimed
that when he lifted up a stone in a wilderness, a spring gushed out and the
place became a fertile rice field, but that was the end of the story. Hoshino
also read about one shrine that had a stone called the Treasure of Children
Stone, but it was more than a yard tall and shaped l ike a phallus. No way that
could be the one Nakata was looking for.
The two of them gave up, left the library, and went to a nearby diner for
dinner. They both had noodles topped with tempura, Hosh ino ordering an
extra bowl of noodles and broth .
" I e n j oyed the l ibrary," Nakata said. " I had no idea there were so many
kinds of cats in the world."
"The stone thing didn't pan out, but that's all right," Hoshino told h i m .
"We j ust got started. Let's get a good night's sleep a n d see what tomorrow
brings."

The next morning they went back to the l ibrary. Like the day before , Hoshino
read through a huge stack of books, one after the other. He'd never read so
many books i n his life . By now he was fairly conversant with the h istory
of Sh ikoku , and he'd learned that people had worsh ipped different kinds of
stones for centur i e s . But what he really wanted - a description of this
entrance stone - was nowhere to be found. By afternoon his head was starting
to ache, so they left the l ibrary, laid down on the grass in a park for a long
while, and gazed at the clouds drifting by. Hosh ino smoked, Nakata sipped at
hot tea from his thermos.
" It's going to thunder again tomorrow," Nakata said.
'
"Meaning you re going to make it thunder?"
"No, Nakata can't do that. The thunder comes by itself."
"Thank God for that," Hoshino said.

They went back to their inn, took a bath , and then Nakata went to bed and
was soon fast asleep. Hoshino watched a baseball game on TV with the sound
down low, but since the Giants were soundly beating Hirosh ima he got dis­
gusted with the whole thing and turned it off. He wasn't sleepy yet and felt
thirsty, so he went out and found a beer hall , and ordered a draft and a plate
of onion rings. He was th inking of striking up a conversation with a young girl
sitting nearby, but figured it wasn't the time or place to make a pass . Tomor­
row morning, after all, it was back to searching for the elusive stone.
He finished his beer, pulled on his Chunichi Dragons cap, left, and j ust
wandered around. Not the most appealing-looking city, he decided, but it felt
pretty good to be walking around wherever he wanted in a place he'd never
been before . He always enjoyed walking, anyway. A Marlboro between his
lips, hands stuck i n his pockets, he wandered from one main street to another
and down various alleys. When he wasn't smoking he whistled. Some parts
were l ively and c rowded, others deserted and deathly quiet. No matter where
he found h i mself, he kept up the same pace . He was young, healthy, carefree ,
with nothing t o fear.
He was walking down a narrow alley full of karaoke bars and clubs that
looked l ike they'd be operating under different names in six months, and had
just come to a dark, deserted spot when somebody called out behind h i m ,
"Hosh ino! Hosh ino! " in a loud voice.
At first he couldn't believe it. Nobody knew him in Takamatsu- it had to
239

be some other Hosh ino. It wasn't that common a name, but not that uncom­
mon, either. He didn't turn around and kept walking. But whoever it was
followed him, calling out his name.
Hoshino finally stopped and turned around. Standing there was a short
old man in a white suit. White hair, a serious pair of glasses, a wh ite mustache
and goatee, wh ite shirt, and string tie . His face looked Japanese , but the
whole outfit made him look more like some country gentleman from the
American South . He wasn't much over five feet tall but looked less l ike a
short person than a miniature, scaled-down version of a man . He held both
hands out in front of him l ike he was carrying a tray.
"Mr. Hoshino," the old man said, his voice clear and piercing, with a bit
of an accent.
Hoshino stared at the man in blank amazement.
"Right you are ! I'm Colonel Sanders."
"You look j ust l ike him," Hoshino said, impressed .
" I don't j ust look l ike Colonel Sanders. It's who I am."
''The fried-chicken guy?"
The old man nodded heavily. "One and the same."
"Okay, but how do you know my name?"
"Chunichi Dragons fans I always call Hoshino. Nagashima's your basic
Giants name - l ikewise, for the Dragons it's got to be Hosh ino, right?"
"Yeah, but Hoshino happens to be my real name."
"Pure coincidence," the old man boomed out. " Don't blame me."
"So what do you want?"
" Have I got a girl for you ! "
"Oh, I get it," Hosh ino said. "You're a pimp. That's why you're dolled up
l ike that."
"Mr. Hoshino, I don't know how many times I have to say th is, but I'm
not dressed up as anybody. I a m Colonel Sanders. Don't get mixed up here,
all right?"
"Okay. . . . But if you're the real Colonel Sanders, what the heck are you
doing working as a pimp in a back alley in Takamatsu? You 're famous, and
must be raking in the dough from license fees alone. You should be kick­
ing back at a poolside somewhere in the States, enjoying your retirement. So
what's the story?"
"There's a kind of a warp at work in the world."
"A warp?"
"You probably don't know th is, but that's how we have three dimensions.

Because of the warp. If you want everything to be nice and straight all the
time, then go l ive in a world made with a triangular ruler."
"You're pretty weird, you know that?" Hoshino said. "But hanging out
with weird old guys seems to be my fate these days. Any more of this and I
won't know up from down."
"That may be, Mr. Hoshino, but how about it? How about a nice girl ? "
"You m e a n l ike o n e o f those massage parlor places?"
" Massage parlor? What's that?"
"You know, those places where they won't let you do the dirty deed but
can manage a BJ or a hand job. Let you come that way, but no i n-and-out."
"No, no," Colonel Sanders said, shaking his head i n irritation. "That's
not it at all. My girls do it all- hand j ob, BJ, whatever you want, including the
old in-and-out."
"Ah hah - so you're talking a soapland."
"What land? "
"Quit kidding around, okay? I 've got somebody with me, and we've got
an early start in the morning. So I don't have time for any fooling around
tonight."
"So you don't want a girl?"
"No girl . No fried chicken . I'm going back to get some sleep."
"But maybe you won't get to sleep that easily?" Colonel Sanders said
knowingly. "When a person's looking for someth i ng and can't find it, they
usually can't sleep very well."
Hoshino stood there, mouth agape , staring at him. "Looking for some­
thing? How'd you know I'm looking for something?"
"It's written all over your face. By nature you 're an honest person . Every­
thing you're thinking is written all over your face. It's l ike one side of a
split-open dried mackerel - everyth ing inside your head's laid out for all
to see."
Instinctively, Hoshino reached up and rubbed his cheek. He spread his
hand open and stared at it, but there was nothing there. Written all over m y face?
"So," Colonel Sanders said, one finger held up for emphasis. "Is what
you're looking for by any chance round and hard? "
Hoshino frowned and said, "Come on, old man, who are you ? How could
you know that?"
"I told you - it's written all over your face. You don't get it, do you?"
Colonel Sanders said, shaking his finger. " I haven't been i n this business all
these years for my health, you know. So you really don't want a girl ? "

'Tm looking for a kind of stone. It's called an entrance stone."
" I know all about it."
"You do?"
" I don't lie. Or tell j okes. I'm a straight-ahead, no-nonsense type of guy."
"Do you know where the stone is?"
" I know exactly where it is."
"So, could you - tell me where?"
Colonel Sanders touched his black-framed glasses and cleared his throat.
"Are you sure you don't want a girl?"
"If you'll tell me where the stone is, I'll think about it," Hoshino said
dubiously.
"Great. Come with me." Without waiting for a reply, he walked briskly
away down the alley.
Hoshino scrambled to keep up. "Hey, old man . Colonel . I 've only got
about two hundred bucks on me."
Colonel Sanders clicked his tongue as he trotted down the road. "That's
plenty. That'll get you a fresh-faced, nineteen-year-old beauty. She'll give you
the full menu - BJ, hand job, in-and-out, you name it. And afterward I'll
throw this i n for free - I'll tell you all about the stone ."
"Jeez Louise," Hosh ino gasped.

Chapter 27

t's 2:47 when I notice the girl's here - a little earl ier than last night. I
glance at the clock by my bed to remember the time. This time I stay up,
waiting for her to appear. Other than the occasional blink I don't close
my eyes once. I thought I was paying attention , but somehow I miss the
actual moment she appears.
She has on her usual l ight blue dress and is sitting there the same as
before, head i n hands, silently gaz ing at the painting of Kafka on the Shore.
And I ' m gazing at her with bated breath . Painting, girl , and me - we form a
still triangle in the room. She never tires of looking at the picture , and l ike­
wise I never tire of gazing at her. The triangle is fixed, unwavering. And then
something totally unexpected happens.
"Miss Saeki," I hear myself say. I hadn't planned on speaking her name,
but the thought welled up i n me and spilled out. I n a very small voice,
but she hears it. And one side of the triangle collapses. Maybe I was secretly
hoping it would - I don't know.
She looks in my direction, though not l ike she's straining to see. Her
head's still i n her hands as she quietly turns her face. Like someth ing - she's
not sure what - has made the air tremble ever so slightly.
I don't know if she can see me, but I want her to . I pray she notices me
and knows I exist. " Miss Saeki ," I repeat. I can't keep myself from saying her
name. Maybe she'll be frightened by my voice and leave the room , never to
return. I 'd feel terrible if that happened. No - not terrible , that's not what I
mean. Devastated is more l ike it. If she never came back everything would be
lost to me forever. All meaning, all direction. Everything. I know this, but I go
ahead and risk it anyway, and call her name. Of their own accord, almost
automatically, my tongue and l ips form her name, over and over.
She's not looking at the painting anymore, she's looking at me. Or at least
I'm in her field of vision. From where I sit I can't see her expression. Clouds
move outside and the moonlight fl ickers. It must be windy, but I can't hear it.

I

" Miss Saeki ," I say again, carried away by some urgent, compelling, over­
whelming force.
She takes her head out of her hands, holds up her right hand i n front of
her as if to tell me not to say anything more . But is that what she really wants
to say? If only I could go up to her and gaze into her eyes, to see what she's
thinking right now, what emotions are running through her. What is she try­
ing to tell me? What is she hinting at? Damn , I wish I knew. But th is heavy,
j ust-before-three-a . m . darkness has snatched away all meaning. It's hard to
breathe, and I close my eyes. There's a hard lump of air in my chest, l ike I 've
swallowed a raincloud whole. When I open my eyes a few seconds later, she's
vanished. All that's left is an empty chair. A shadow of a cloud slides across the
wall above the desk.
I get out of bed, go over to the window, and look at the night sky. And
think about time that can never be regained. I th ink of rivers , of tides. Forests
and water gush ing out. Rain and l ightning. Rocks and shadows. All of these
are 111 me.

The next day, in the afternoon, a detective stops by the l ibrary. I ' m lying low
in my room and don't know he's there . The detective questions Oshima for
about twenty minutes and then leaves. Oshima comes to my room later to fill
me 111.
"A detective from a local precinct was asking about you ," Osh ima says,
then takes a bottle of Perrier from the fridge, uncaps it, pours the water i nto a
glass, and takes a drink.
"How did he know I was here?"
''You used a cell phone. Your dad's phone."
I check my memory and nod . That night I ended up all bloody in
the woods behind that shrine, I called Sakura on the cell phone. "I did, but
j ust once."
"The police checked the calling record and traced YOll to Takamatsll.
Usually pol ice don't get into details, but wh ile we were chatting I got h i m to
explain how they traced the cal l . When I want to I can turn on the charm. H e
also let o u t that they couldn't trace the person you called, so it must've been a
prepaid phone. Anyhow, they know you were in Takamatsu, and the local
police have been checking all the hotels. They found out that a boy named
Kafka Tamura matching your description stayed in a business hotel i n town ,
through a special arrangment with the YMCA, until May 28th . The same day
somebody murdered your father."
244

At least the pol ice didn't find out about Sakura . I'm thankful for that,
having bothered her enough already.
"The hotel manager remembered that you 'd asked about our library.
Remember how he called to see if you were really coming here?"
I nod.
"That's why the police stopped by." Oshima takes a sip of Perrier. "Natu­
rally I lied. I told the detective I hadn't seen you since the 28th . That you'd
been coming every day, but not once since."
"You might get i nto trouble," I say.
"If I didn't l i e , you'd be in a whole lot more trouble."
"But I don't want to get you involved."
Oshima narrows his eyes and smiles. "You don't get it, do you? You
already have gotten me involved."
"Yeah, I guess so-"
"Let's not argue, okay? What's done is done. Talking about it now won 't
get us anywhere."
I nod, not saying a word .
"Anyway, the detective left his card and told me to call h i m right away if
you ever showed up again."
"Am I a suspect?"
Oshima slowly shakes his head . "I doubt it. But they do think you might
be able to help them out. I 've been following all this in the newspaper. The
investigation isn't getting anywhere, and the police are getting i mpatient. No
fingerprints, no clues, no witnesses. You're the only lead they have . Which
explains why they're trying so hard to track you down . Your dad's famous, too,
so the murder's been covered in detail on TV and in magazines. The pol ice
aren't about to sit around and twiddle their thumbs."
"But if they find out you lied to them, they won't accept you as a witness
anymore-and there goes my alibi . T h ey might th ink I did it."
Oshima shook h is head again. "Japanese police aren't that stupid, Kafka .
Lacking i n imagination, yes, but they're not i ncompetent. I ' m sure they've
already checked all the passenger lists for planes from Tokyo to Sh ikoku .
I don't know if you're aware of this, but they have video cameras set up
at all the gates at airports, to photograph all the boarding passengers. By
now they know you didn't fly back to Tokyo around the time of the incident.
Information i n Japan is micromanaged , bel ieve me. So the pol ice don't
consider you a suspect. If they did, they wouldn't send some local cop, but
detectives from the National Police Agency. If that happened they would've
grilled me pretty hard and there's no way I could've outsmarted the m . They

j ust want to hear from you whatever information you can provide about the
incident."
It makes perfect sense, what he says .
"Anyhow, you'd better keep a low profile for a wh ile," he says. "The
police might be staking out the area, keeping an eye out for you . They had
photos of you with them. Copies of your official j unior h igh class pictur e .
Can't say i t looked much l ike you, though . You looked really mad i n the
photo."
That was the only photograph I left beh ind. I always tried to avoid having
my picture taken, but not having th is one taken wasn't an option.
"The police said you were a troublemaker at school . There were some
violent incidents involving you and your classmates . And you were suspended
three times."
"Twice, not three times. And I wasn't suspended, j ust officially grounded,"
I explain. I breathe i n deeply, then slowly breathe out. " I have times l ike
that, yeah."
"You can't control yourself," Oshima says.
I nod.
"And you hurt other people?"
" I don't mean to. But it's like there's somebody else l iving inside m e .
And when I come to, I fi n d out I 've h urt somebody."
" Hurt them how much?" Oshima asks.
I sigh. "Noth ing major. No broken bones or missing teeth or anyth ing."
Oshima sits down on the bed, crosses his legs, and brushes his hair off
his forehead. He's wearing navy blue chinos, a black polo shirt, and wh ite
Adidas. " Seems to me you have a lot of issues you 've got to deal with ."
A lot of issues. I look up. "Don't you have any?"
Oshima holds his hands in the air. "Not all that many. But there is one
thing. For me, inside th is physical body - this defective container - the most
important j ob is surviving from one day to the next. It could be simple, or very
hard . It all depends on how you look at it. E ither way, even if th i ngs go well ,
that's not some great achievement. Nobody's going to give me a standing
ovation or anything."
I bite my lip for a wh ile, then ask, "Don't you ever think about getting out
of that container?"
"You mean leaving my physical body?"
I nod.
" Symbolically? Or for real?"

"Either one."
Oshima flips his hair back with a hand. I can picture the gears going full
speed j ust below the surface of his pale forehead. "Are you th inking you'd l ike
to do that?"
I take a breath . "Oshima, to tell you the unvarnished truth , I don't l ike
the container I'm stuck in. Never have. I hate it, in fact. My face, my hands,
my blood, my genes . . . I hate everyth ing I inherited from my parents . I 'd l ike
nothing better than to escape it all, l ike running away from home."
He gazes into my face and smiles. "You have a nice, muscular body. No
matter who you inherited it from , you're quite handsome. Wel l , maybe a l i ttle
too unique to be called handsome, exactly. But you're not bad looking. At
least I l ike the way you look. You're smart, you're qu ick. You 've got a nice
cock, too. I envy you that. You're going to have tons of girls fall for you , guar­
anteed. So I can't see what you're dissatisfied with about your container."
I blush .
"Okay, I guess that's all beside the point," Osh ima continues. ''I'm not
crazy about the container I'm in, that's for sure. How could I be - this
crummy piece of work? It's pretty inconvenient, I can tell you . Still, inside
here, th is is what I th ink: If we reverse the outer shell and the essence - i n
other words, consider the outer shell the essence a n d the essence only the
shell - ou r l ives might be a whole lot easier to understand."
I stare at my hands, th inking about all that blood on them, how sticky
they felt. I think about my own essence, my own shel l . The essence of me,
surrounded by the shell that's me. But these thoughts are driven away by one
indelible image : all that blood .
" How about Miss Saeki?" I ask.
"What do you mean? "
"You think she has issues to overcome?"
"You'd better ask her yourself," Oshima says .

At two I take a cup of coffee on a tray up to M iss Saeki 's room , where she's sit­
ting at her desk. Like always there's writing paper and a fountain pen on the
desk, but the pen is still capped. Both hands resting on the desk, she's staring
off into space. Not l ike she's looking at anything, j ust gazing at a place that
isn't there. She seems tired. The window behind her is ope n , the early sum­
mer breeze rustl i ng the white lace curtain. The scene looks l ike some beauti­
ful allegorical painting.

247

"Thank you ," she says when 1 put the coffee cup on her desk.
"You look a l ittle tired."
She nods. " I imagine 1 look a lot older when 1 get tired ."
"Not at all. You look wonderful, like always."
She smiles. " For someone so young, you certainly know how to flatter a
won1an ."
My face reddens.
Miss Saeki points to a chair. The same chair as yesterday, in exactly the
same position. 1 take a seat.
"I'm used to being tired, but 1 don't imagine you are."
" I guess not."
"When 1 was fifteen 1 wasn't either, of course ." She picks up the coffee
cup and takes a sip. "Kafka, what can you see outside?"
1 look out the window behind her. " I see trees, the sky, and some clouds.
Some birds on tree branches."
"Nothing out of the ordinary. Right?"
"That's right."
"But if you knew you might not be able to see it again tomorrow, everything would suddenly become special and precious, wouldn't it?"
"I suppose so."
"Have you ever thought about that?"
"I have."
A surprised look comes over her. "When?"
"When I'm in love," 1 tell her.
She smiles faintly, and it continues to hover around her l ips. This puts
me in mind of how refreshing water looks after someone's sprinkled it in a
tiny hollow outside on a summer day.
"Are you in love?" she asks .
"Yes."
"And her face and whole being are special and precious to you , each time
you see her?"
"That's right. And 1 might lose those."
Miss Saeki looks at me for a while, and the smile fades away. "Picture
a bird perched on a th in branch," she says . "The branch sways in the
wind, and each time this happens the bird's field of vision shifts. You know
what 1 mean? "
1 nod.
"When that happens, how do you th ink the bird adj usts?"
1 shake my head. " I don't know."

"It bobs its head up and down , making up for the sway of the branch.
Take a good look at birds the next time it's windy. I spend a lot of time looking
out that window. Don't you th ink that kind of l ife would be tiring? Always
shifting your head every time the branch you 're on sways?"
" I do."
" B i rds are used to it. It comes naturally to them . They don't have to th ink
about it, they j ust do it. So it's not as tiring as we imagine. But I'm a human
being, not a bird, so sometimes it does get tiring."
"You 're on a branch somewhere?"
"In a manner of speaking," she says . "And sometimes the wind blows
pretty hard." She places the cup back on the saucer and takes the cap off her
fountain pen .
This is my signal, so I stand up. "Miss Saeki , there's something I 've got to
ask you."
"Something personal?"
"Yes. And maybe out of line, too."
"But it's i mportant?"
" For me it is."
She puts the pen back on the desk, and her eyes fill with a kind of neutral
glow. "All right. Go ahead."
"Do you have any chidlren?"
She takes i n a breath and pauses. The expression on her face slowly
retreats somewhere far away, then comes back. Kind of l ike a parade that
disappears down a street, then marches back up the same street toward
you agam.
"Why do you want to know that?"
"It's personal . It's not j ust some spur-of-the-moment question."
She l ifts up her Mont Blanc like she's testing the thickness and heft of it,
then sets it on the desk and looks up. "I'm sorry, but I can't give you a yes or
no answer. At least right now. I'm tired, and there's a strong wind blowing."
I nod. "Sorry. I shouldn't have asked."
"It's all right. I'm not blaming you," she says gently. "Thank you for the
coffee. You make excellent coffee."

I leave and go back down the stairs to my room. I sit on my bed and try to
read, but noth i ng seems to filter into my head. I feel l ike I ' m gaz ing at some
table of random numbers, j ust following the words with my eyes. I put my
book down , go over to the window, and look at the garden. There are birds on
2'-19

some of the branches, but no wind to speak of. Am I i n love with M iss Saeki
when she was fifteen? Or with the real , fifty-something Miss Saeki upstairs?
I don't know anymore . The boundary line separating the two has started to
waver, to fade, and I can't focus. And that confuses me. I close my eyes and try
to find some center inside to hold on to.
But you know, she's right. Every single day, each time I see her face, see
her, it's utterly precious.

Chapter 28

or a man his age Colonel Sanders was l ight on his feet, and so fast that
he resembled a veteran speed walker. And he seemed to know every
nook and cranny of the city. He took short cuts up dark, narrow stair­
cases, turning sideways to squeeze through the narrow passages between
houses. He l eaped over a ditch, hushing a barking dog beh ind a hedge with a
short command. Like some restless spirit searching for its home, his small
white-suited figure raced through the back alleys of the town . It was all
Hoshino could do to keep up. He was soon out of breath , his armpits soaked.
Colonel Sanders never once looked back to see if he was following.
"Hey, are we almost there?" Hoshino finaIly caIled out i mpatiently.
"What are you talking about, young feIlow? I wouldn't even caIl this a
walk," Colonel Sanders repl ied, stiIl not turning around.
"Yeah , but I ' m a customer, remember? What's going to happen to my sex
drive if I'm all pooped out?"
"What a disgrace! And you caIl yourself a man? If a little walk's going to
kiIl your desire, you might as weIl not have any from the beginning."
"Jeez," Hoshino muttered . •
Colonel Sanders cut across another side street, crossed a main road,
oblivious to the traffic light, and continued walking. He strode over a bridge
and ducked i nto a shrine. A fairly big shrine, by the looks of it, but it was late
and no one else was around. Colonel Sanders pointed to a bench in front of
the shrine office, indicating that Hosh ino should take a seat. A mercury lamp
was next to the bench, and everything was as bright as day. Hoshino did as he
was told, and Colonel Sanders sat down next to h i m .
"You're n o t going t o make me d o it here, a r e you?" Hoshino asked
worriedly.
" Don't be an idiot. We're not l ike those deer that hang around the
famous shrines and go at it. I'm not about to have you do it i n a shrine. Who

P

do you th ink I am, anyway?" Then he extracted a silver cell phone from his
pocket and punched in a three-digit number. "Yeah, it's me," he said when
the other person answered. "The usual place . The shrine. I've got a young
man named Hosh ino here with me. That's right . . . the same as usual . Yes , I
got it. Just get here as soon as you can." He switched off the phone and
slipped it back into the pocket of his white suit.
"Do you always call up the girls from th is shrine?" Hosh ino asked.
"Anything wrong with that?"
"No, not really. I was j ust th inking there's got to be a better place. Some­
place more . . . normal? A coffee shop, or maybe have me wait i n a hotel
room?"
"A shrine's quiet. And the air's crisp and clean ."
"True, but waiting for a girl on a bench in front of a shrine office - it's
hard to relax. I feel l ike I'm going to fall under the spell of one of those fox
spirits or something."
"What are you talking about? You're not making fun of Shikoku now, are
you? Takamatsu's a proper city - the prefectural capital , i n fact. Not some
hick town. We don't have any foxes here ."
"Okay, okay, j ust kidding . . . . But you're in the service industry, so I was
j ust thinking you'd better worry more about creating an atmosphere, you
know what I'm saying? Something luxurious, to get you in the mood. I don't
know, maybe it's none of my business."
"You're right. It isn't," Colonel Sanders intoned. "Now about that
stone . . . "
" Right! The stone . . . Tell me about it."
"After you do the deed. Then we talk."
" Doing the deed's important, huh?"
Colonel Sanders nodded gravely a couple of times, and tugged at his
goatee. "That's right. It's a formality you have to go through . Then we'll talk
about the stone. I know you're going to l ike this girl . She's our top girl . Lus­
cious breasts , skin l ike silk. A nice, curvy waist, hot and wet right where you
l ike it, a regular sex machine. To use a car metaphor, she's four-wheel drive in
bed, turbocharged desire, step on the gas, the surging gearsh ift in her hands,
you round the corner, she shifts gears ecstatically, you race out i n the passing
lane, and bang! You're there - Hosh ino's dead and gone to heaven."
"You're quite a character, you know that?" Hoshino said admiringly.
"Like I said, I'm not i n th is business for my health ."

Fifteen minutes later the girl arrived, and Colonel Sanders was right - she
was a knockout. Tight miniskirt, black high heels, a small black-enamel
shoulder bag. She could easily have been a model. Generous breasts , too,
spilling out of her low-cut top.
"Will she do?" Colonel Sanders asked.
Hoshino was too stunned to reply, and j ust nodded.
"A veritable sex machine, Hoshino. Have yourself a bal l ," Colonel San­
ders said, smiling for the first time. He gave Hosh ino a pinch on the rump.
The girl took Hoshino to a nearby love hotel, where she filled up the
bathtub, quickly slipped out of her clothes, and then undressed h i m . She
washed h i m carefully all over, then commenced to lick him, sliding into a
totally artistic act of fellatio, doing things to him he'd never seen or heard of
in his life . He couldn't think of anything else but coming, and come he did.
"Man alive , that was fantastic . I 've never felt l ike that," Hoshino said,
languidly sinking back i n the hot tub.
"That's j ust the beginning," the girl said. "Wait till you see what's next."
"Yeah , but man that was good ."
" How good?"
" Like there's no past or future anymore ."
"The pure present is an ungraspable advance of the past devouring the
future. In truth, all sensation is already memory."
Hosh ino looked up, mouth half open, and gazed at her face. "What's
that?"
" Henri Bergson ," she repl ied, l icking the semen from the tip of his penis.
"Marne mo memelay."
'Tm sorry?"
"Matter and Memory. You ever read it?"
"I don't th ink so," Hosh ino repl ied after a moment's thought. Except for
the special S D F driver's manual he was forced to study - and the books on
Sh ikoku h istory he'd j ust gone through at the l ibrary - he couldn't remember
reading anything except manga.
"Have you read it?"
The girl nodded . " I had to. I'm majoring in philosophy in college, and
we have exams coming up."
"You don't say," Hoshino said. "So this is a part-time job?"
"To help pay tuition."
She took him over to the bed, stroked him all over with her fingertips and
tongue, getting another erection out of him. A firm hard-on, a Tower of Pisa
at carnival time.
253

" See, you're ready to go again," the girl remarked, slowly segueing into
her next set of motions. "Any special requests? Something you'd l ike me to
do? Mr. Sanders asked me to make sure you got everything you want."
" I can't think of anyth ing special , but could you quote some more of that
philosophy stuff? 1 don't know why, but it might keep me from coming so
quick. Otherwise I'll lose it pretty fast."
"Let's see . . . . Th is is pretty old, but how about some Hegel ?"
"Whatever."
"I recommend Hegel. He's sort of out of date , but definitely an oldie but
goodie."
" Sounds good to me."
"At the same time that T am the content of a relation, T am also that
which does the relating."
"HInm . . . "
"Hegel bel ieved that a person is not merely conscious of self and object
as separate entities, but through the projection of the self via the mediation of
the object is volitionally able to gain a deeper understanding of the self. All of
which constitutes self-consciousness."
"I don't know what the heck you're talking about."
"Well, th ink of what I'm doing to you right now. For me I'm the self, and
you're the obj ect. For you, of course, it's the exact opposite - you're the self to
you and I'm the object. And by exchanging self and obj ect, we can project
ourselves onto the other and gain self-consciousness . Vol itionally."
"I still don't get it, but it sure feels good."
"That's the whole idea," the girl said.

Afterward he said good-bye to the girl and returned to the shrine, where
Colonel Sanders was sitting on the bench j ust as he'd left h i m .
"You been waiting here the whole time?" Hoshino asked.
Colonel Sanders shook his head irritably. "Don't be a moron . Do I really
look l ike I have that much time on my hands? While you were sailing off to
heaven, 1 was working the back alleys again. She called me when you
finished, and I rushed over. So, how was our little sex machine? Pretty good,
I'll bet."
"She was great. No complai nts by me. I got off three times. Volitionally
speaking. 1 must've lost five pounds."
"Glad to hear it. Now, about the stone . . . "
" Right, that's what I came here for."
254

"Actually, the stone's in the woods right here in this shrine."
"We're talking about the entrance stone?"
"That's right. The entrance stone."
"Are you sure you're not j ust making this up?"
Colonel Sanders's head shot up. "What are you talking about, you ding­
bat? Have I ever lied to you? Do I j ust make up things? I told you I 'd get you
a supple young sex machine, and I kept my end of the barga i n . At a bargai n­
basement price, too - only $120, and you were brazen enough to shoot off
three times, no less. All that and you still doubt me?"
" Don't blow a fuse! Of course I believe you. It's j ust that when th ings are
going along a l i ttle too smoothly, I get a bit suspicious, that's all. I mean, think
about it - I'm walking along and a guy in a funny getup calls out to me, tells
me he knows where to find the stone, then I go with him and get off with this
drop-dead-gorgeous babe."
"Three times, you mean."
"Whatever. So I get off three times, and then you tel l me the stone I ' m
looking for is right over there? That would confuse anybody."
"You stil l don't get it, do you? We're talking about a revelation here,"
Colonel Sanders said, cl icking his tongue. "A revelation leaps over the bor­
ders of the everyday. A life without revelation is no life at all. What you need
to do is move from reason that observes to reason that acts. That's what's criti­
cal . Do you have any idea what I'm talking about, you gold-plated whale of
a dunce?"
"The projection and exchange between self and object . . . ? " Hosh ino
timidly bega n .
"Good. I ' m glad you know that much a t least. That's t h e point. Follow
me, and you can pay your respects to your precious stone. A special package
deal, just for you."

Chapter 29

call up Sakura from the public phone in the l ibrary. I real ize I haven't
been in touch once since that night at her place - j ust a short note and
that was it. I'm kind of embarrassed about the way I said good-bye . After
I left her apartment I went right to the l ibrary, Oshima drove me up to the
cabin for a few days, well out of range of any phone. Then I came to l ive and
work at the l ibrary, encountering Miss Saeki's l iving spiri t - or something like
it - every night. And I 've fallen head over heels for that fifteen-year-old girl . A
ton of th ings happened , one after another - enough to keep anybody busy.
Not that that's any excuse.
It's around nine p.m. when I call, and she answers after six rings .
"Where in the world have you been?" Sakura asks i n a hard voice.
''I ' m still in Takamatsu."
She doesn't say anything for a while. In the background I hear a music
program on TV.
" Somehow I 've survived," I add.
Silence, then a kind of resigned sigh .
"What d i d you mean b y disappearing l ike that? I was worried about you ,
so I came home a little early that day. Even did some shopping for us."
" I know it was wrong. I do. But I had to leave . My mind was all messed up
and I had to get away to think things out, try to get back on my feet. Being
with you was - I don't know - I can't put it into words."
"Overstimulating?"
"Yeah . I 've never been near a girl l ike that before ."
"No kidding?"
"You know, the scent of a girl . All kinds of things . . . "
"Pretty rough being young, huh?"
" I guess," I say. "So how's your job going?"
"It's been a madhouse . But I wanted to work and save up some money, so
I shouldn't complain."

I

I pause , then tell her about the pol ice looking for me.
She's silent for a while, then cautiously says, "All that business with
the blood?"
I decide to hold back on telling the truth . "No, that's not it. Noth ing
about the blood. They're after me because I'm a runaway. They want to catch
me and ship me back to Tokyo, that's all. So the cops might get in touch with
you . The other day, the night I stayed over, I called your cell phone using
mine, and they traced the phone records and found I was here i n Takamatsu."
" Don't worry," she says. "It's a prepa id phone, so there's no way they can
trace the owner."
"That's a rel ief," I say. "I didn't want to cause you any more trouble than
I already have ."
"You're so sweet you're going to make me cry, you know that?"
"No, that's how I really feel."
" I know," she says l ike she'd rather not admit it. "So where's our l i ttle runaway staying these days?"
" Somebody I know is letting me stay over."
" Since when do you know anybody here?"
How could I possibly summarize everyth ing that's happened to me in
the past few days? "It's a long story," I say.
"With you it's always long stories."
"I don't know why, but it always turns out that way."
" Sort of a tendency of yours?"
" I guess so," I reply. 'Til tell you all about it someday when I have the
time. It's not l ike I'm h iding anything. I j ust can't explain it well over the
phone."
"That's okay. I j ust hope you're not into anyth ing you shouldn't be."
"No, noth ing l ike that. I'm okay, don't worry."
She sighs aga i n . "I can understand wanting to be out on your own , but
j ust don't get mixed up with anyth ing illegal , okay? It isn't worth it. I don't
want to see you die some miserable teenage death l ike Billy the Kid."
"B illy the Kid didn't die in his teens," I correct her. "He killed twenty-one
people and died when he was twenty-one."
"If you say so . . . . Anyway, was there someth ing you wanted? "
"I j ust wanted t o thank you . I feel bad about leaving l ike that after you
were so nice."
"Thanks, but why don't we j ust forget that, okay?"
"I wanted to hear your voice, too," I say.
''I'm happy to hear that, but how does that help anyth ing?"
257

" I don't know how to put it exactly . . . . Th is might sound strange, but
you're l iving i n the real world, breathing real air, speaking real words. Talking
with you makes me feel, for the time being, connected to real ity. And that's
really important to me now."
"The people you're with now aren't?"
'Tm not sure," I tell her.
"So what you 're saying is you're in some unreal place, with people cut off
from reality?"
I think about that for a while. "You might say that."
"Kafka," Sakura says. "I know it's your life and I shouldn't butt in, but I
think you'd better get out of there. I don't know what kind of place you're i n ,
b u t I get the feeling that's the smart move . C a l l it a h u n c h . Why don't you
come over to my place? You can stay as long as you l ike."
"Why are you so nice to me?"
"What are you , a dunce?"
"What do you mean? "
'' 'Cause I like you - can't you figure that out? I ' m a basically curious
type , but I wouldn't do this for j ust anybody. I 've done all th is for you because
I like you , okay? I don't know how to put it, but you feel l ike a younger brother
to me."
I hold the phone without saying a word . For a second I ' m completely
confused, even dizzy. Nobody's ever said anything l ike that to me. Ever.
"You still there?" Sakura asks .
"Yeah," I manage to say.
"Well, then say something."
I stand up straight and take a deep breath . " Sakura, I wish I could do
that. I really do. But I can't right now. Like I told you , I can't leave here. I ' m
in love ."
"With some complicated, unreal person?"
"You could say that."
I hear her sigh again - a deep, profound kind of sigh . "You know, when
kids your age fall in love they tend to get a l ittle spacey, so if the person
you're in love with isn't connected to reality, that's a major problem. You
follow me?"
"Yeah, I get it."
" Kafka?"
" Hrnm?"
"If anything happens, call me, okay? Don't hesitate , at all."
" I appreciate it."

I hang up, go back to my room, put the single of " Kafka on the Shore" on
the turntable, and lower the needle. And once more, whether I l ike it or not,
I'm swept away to that place. To that time.

I sense a presence and open my eyes. It's totally dark. The fluorescent num­
bers on the alarm clock next to my bed show it's after three. I must've fallen
asleep. I n the faint l ight from the lamppost out in the garden I see her sitting
there. As always she's at the desk, gazing at the painting on the wal l . Motion­
less, head in her hands. And I'm lying in bed as before, trying hard not to
breathe, eyes barely open, gazing at her silhouette. Outside the window the
breeze from the sea is rustling the branches of the dogwood.
After a while, though, I sense that someth ing's different. Something in
the air that disturbs the perfect harmony of our l ittle world. I strain to see
through the gloom. What is it? The wind momentarily picks up, and the
blood coursing through my veins begins to feel strangely th ick and heavy.
The dogwood branches draw a nervous maze on the windowpane. Finally it
comes to me. The silhouette isn't that of the young girl. It looks a lot l ike her,
almost an exact match. But it isn't exactly the same. Like a copy of a drawing
laid over the real th ing, some of the details are off. Her hairstyle is different,
for one thing. And she has on different clothes. Her whole presence is differ­
ent. Unconsciously I shake my head . It isn't the girl sitting there - it's some­
one else. Someth ing's happening, something very important. I ' m clutching
my hands tightly beneath the covers, and my heart, unable to stand it any­
more, starts pounding hard, beating out an unexpected, erratic rhythm.
As if that sound is the signal, the silhouette i n the chair starts to move,
slowly changing its angle l ike some massive ship changing course . She takes
her head out of her hands and turns in my direction. With a start I real ize it's
Miss Saeki. I gulp and can't let my breath out. It's the Miss Saeki of the pres­
ent. The real M iss Saeki . She looks at me for a while, quietly concentrating
l ike when she's looking at the painting, and a thought hits me - th e axis of
time. Somewhere I don't know about, something weird is happening to time.
Reality and dreams are all mixed up, l ike seawater and river water flow­
ing together. I struggle to find the meaning behind it all, but noth i ng makes
any sense.
Finally she gets to her feet and slowly comes toward me, holding herself
as erect as always. She's barefoot, and the floorboards faintly creak as she
walks. Silently she sits down on the edge of the bed, and remains still for a
time. Her body has a definite density and weight. She has on a wh ite silk
259

blouse and a navy blue skirt that reaches to her knees. She reaches out and
touches my head, her fingers groping through my short hair. Her hand is real,
with real fingers touching me. She stands up again, and in the faint l ight
shining in from outside - like it's the most natural thing to do - begins to
undress. She's in no hurry, but she doesn't hesitate , either. In smooth , natural
motions she unbuttons her blouse, sl ips out of her skirt, and steps out of her
panties. Piece by piece her clothing falls to the floor, the soft fabric hardly
making a sound. She's asleep, I realize . Her eyes are open but it's l ike she's
sleepwalking.
Once she's naked she crawls into the narrow bed and wraps her pale arms
around me. Her warm breath grazes my neck, her pubic hair pushing up
against my thigh . She must think I'm her dead boyfriend from long ago, and
that she's doing what they used to do here in this very room. Fast asleep,
dreaming, she goes through the motions from long ago.
I figure I 'd better wake her up. She's making a big mistake, and I have to
let her know. This isn't a dream - it's real life. But everything's happening so
fast, and I don't have the strength to resist. Thrown totally off balance, I feel
l ike I'm being sucked into a time warp .
And you're sucked into a time warp.
Before you know it, her dream has wrapped itself around your mind.
Gently, warmly, like amniotic fluid. Miss Saeki will take off your T-shirt,
pull off your boxers. She'll kiss your neck over and over, then reach out
and hold your penis, which is already porcelain-hard. Gently she wraps
her hand around your balls, and wordlessly guides your fingers to her
pubic hair. Her vagina is warm and wet. She kisses your chest, sucking
your nipples. Your fingers are slowly sucked inside her.
Where does your responsibility begin here? Wiping away the nebula
from your sight, you struggle to find where you really are. You're trying to
find the direction of the flow, struggling to hold on to the axis of time. But
you can't locate the borderline separating dream and reality. Or even the
boundary between what's real and what's possible. All you're sure of is that
you're in a delicate position. Delicate-and dangerous. You're pulled
along, a part of it, unable to pin down the principles of prophecy, or of
logic. Like when a river overflows, washing over a town, all road signs have
sunk beneath the waves. And all you can see are the anonymous roofs of
the sunken houses.
You're faceup, and Miss Saeki gets on top of you. She guides your
rock-hard cock inside her. You're helpless-she's the one who's in charge.
She bends and twists her waist as if tracing a picture with her body. Her

260

straight hair falls on your shoulders and trembles noiselessly, like the
branches of a willow. Little by little you're sucked down into the warm
mud. The whole world turns warm, wet, indistinct, and all that exists is
your rigid, glistening cock. You close your eyes and your own dream
begins. It's hard to tell how much time is passing. The tide comes in,
the moon rises. And soon you come. There's nothing you can do to stop it.
You come over and over inside her. The warm walls inside her contract,
gathering in your semen. All this while she's still asleep with her eyes
wide open. She's in a different world, and that's where your seed goes­
swallowed down into a place apart.

A long time passes. I can't move. Every part of me is paralyzed. Paralyzed ,
or else maybe I j ust don't feel l ike trying t o move. S h e gets off a n d l ies down
beside me. After a while she gets up, tugs on her panties, pulls on her skirt,
and buttons up her blouse. She gently reaches out again and tousles my hair.
All th is takes place without a word passing between us. She hasn't said a thing
since she entered the room. The only sounds are the creak of the floorboards,
the wind blowing ceaselessly outside. The room breathing out, the window­
pane sh ivering. That's the chorus behind me.
Still asleep, she crosses the room and leaves. The door's open j ust a crack
but she sl ips right out like a delicate, dreamy fish . Silently the door closes. I
watch from the bed as she makes her exit, still unable to move. I can't even
raise a finger. My lips are tightly sealed. Words are asleep in a corner of time.
Unable to move a muscle, I lie there straining to hear. I imagine I'll catch
the roar of her Golf in the parking lot. But I never hear it, no matter how long
I l isten. The wind blows clouds over, then scatters them away. The branches
of the dogwood quiver, and countless knives flash in the darkness. The win­
dow is my heart's window, the door my soul 's door. I lie there awake until
clawn , gazing at the empty chair.

Chapter 30

he two of them scrambled over the low hedge into the woods.
Colonel Sanders took a small flashlight out of his pocket and illumi­
nated the narrow path . The woods weren't very deep, but the trees
were hugely ancient, the tangle of their branches looming darkly above . A
strong grassy odor came from the ground below.
Colonel Sanders took the lead, for once maintaining a leisurely pace.
Shining the flashlight to make sure of his footing, he cautiously took one step
at a time.
Hoshino followed right behind. "Hey, Unc, is this some kind of dare or
something?" he said to the Colonel's wh ite back. "Whoa - a ghost!"
"Why don't you zip it for a change," Colonel Sanders said without turn­
ing around.
"Okay, okay." Hoshino suddenly wondered how Nakata was doing. Prob­
ably still sound asleep. It's l ike the term sound asleep was invented j ust to
describe him - once he falls asleep, that's all she wrote . What kind of dreams
does he have, though , during those record-breaking sleeps? Hosh ino couldn't
imagine. "Are we there yet?"
"Almost," Colonel Sanders repl ied.
'''lell me something," Hoshino began.
"What?"
"Are you really Colonel Sanders?"
Colonel Sanders cleared his throat. "Not really. I'm j ust taking on his
appearance for a time."
"That's what I figured," Hoshino said. "So what are you really?"
"I don't have a name."
"How do you get along without one?"
"No problem. Originally I don't have a name or a shape."
"So you're kind of l ike a fart."

T

"You could say that. Since I don't have a shape I can become anyth ing
I want."
"Huh . . . "
'Th is tim e I decided to take on a familiar shape, that of a famous capital­
ist icon. I was toying with the idea of Mickey Mouse, but Disney's particular
about the rights to their characters."
"I don't th ink I 'd want Mickey Mouse pimping for me anyway."
"I see your point."
" Dressing up l ike Colonel Sanders fits your character, too ."
"But I don't have a character. Or any feelings . Shape I may take, converse
I may, but neither god nor Buddha am I, rather an insensate being whose heart
thus differs from that of man."
"What the - ? "
" A line from U e d a Akinari's Tales of Moonlight and Rain. I doubt you've
read it."
"You got me there."
"I'm appearing here in human form, but I'm neither god nor Buddha .
My heart works differently from humans' hearts because I don't have any
feelings. That's what it means."
"Hmm," Hosh ino said. 'Tm not sure I follow, but what you're saying is
you're not a person and not a god or Buddha either, right?"
"Neither god nor Buddha, just the insensate. As such, of the good and bad
of man I neither inquire nor follow."
"Meaning?"
" S ince I'm neither god nor Buddha, I don't need to j udge whether
people are good or evi l . Likewise I don't have to act according to standards of
good and evil."
"In other words you exist beyond good and evi l ."
"You're too kind . I'm not beyond good and evil, exactly - they j ust don't
matter to me. I have no idea what's good or what's evi l . I'm a very pragmatic
being. A neutral object, as it were , and all I care about is consummating the
function I 've been given to perform ."
"Consummate your function? What's that?"
"Didn't you go to school?"
"Yeah , I went to h igh school , but it was a trade school. I spent all my time
screwing around on motorcyles."
''I'm kind of an overseer, supervising something to make sure it fulfills
its original role. Checking the correlation between different worlds, making

sure things are in the right order. So results follow causes and meanings don't
get all mixed up. So the past comes before the present, the future after it.
Things can get a little out of order, that's okay. Nothing's perfect. If the
account book's basically in balance, though, that's fine by me. To tel l you the
truth , I'm not much of a detail person. The technical term for it is 'Abbreviat­
ing Sensory Processing of Continuous Information,' but I don't want to get
into all that. It'd take too long to explain, and I know it's beyond you . So let's
cut to the chase . What I'm getting at is I'm not going to complain about each
and every little th ing. Of course if the accounts don't eventually balance, that
is a problem. I do have my responsibility to consider."
" I got a question for you. If you're such an important person, how come
you're a pimp in a back alley in Takamatsu?"
" I am not a person, okay? How many times do I have to tel l you?"
"Whatever . . . "
"Pimping's j ust a means of getting you here. There's something I need
you to lend me a hand with, so as a reward I thought I 'd let you have a good
time first. A kind of formality we have to go through ."
"Lend you a hand?"
"As I 've explained, I don't have any form. I'm a metaphysical, conceptual
object. I can take on any form, but I lack substance. And to perform a real act,
I need someone with substance to help out."
"And at this particular point that substance happens to be me."
"Exactly," Colonel Sanders replied.
They cautiously continued down the path, and came to a smaller shrine
beneath a th ick oak tree. The shrine was old and dilapidated, with no offer­
ings or decorations of any kind.
Colonel Sanders shined his flashlight on it. "The stone's inside there .
Open the door."
"No way!" Hoshino repl ied. "You're not supposed to open up shrines
whenever you feel l ike it. You'll be cursed. Your nose will fall off. Or your ears
or something."
"Not to worry. I said it's all right, so go ahead and open it. You won't
be cursed. Your nose and ears won't fall off. God, you can be really old­
fashioned."
"Then why don't you open it? I don't want to get mixed up in that."
"How many times clo I have to explain this?! I told you already I don't
have substance. I'm an abstract concept. I can't do anything on my own .
That's why I went to the trouble of dragging you out here . And letting you d o
i t three times a t a discount rate ."

"Yeah , man , she was fantastic . . . but robbing a shrine? No way! My
grandfather always told me not to mess with shrines. H e was really strict
about it."
" Forget about your grandfather. Don't lay all your Gifu Prefecture,
country-bumpkin morality on me, okay? We don't have time for that."
Grumbling all the while, Hoshino hesitantly opened the door of the
shrine, and Colonel Sanders shined his flashlight inside. Sure enough, there
was an old round stone inside. Just l ike Nakata sa id, it was about the size of a
big rice cake , a smooth white stone.
"This is it?" Hoshino asked.
"That's right," Colonel Sanders said. "Take it out."
" Hold on a minute. That's stealing."
"No matter. Nobody's going to notice if a stone l ike this is missing. And
nobody'll care."
"Yeah , but the stone is owned by God , right? He's gonna be pissed if we
take it out."
Colonel Sanders folded his arms and stared straight at Hosh ino. "What
is God?"
The question threw Hoshino for a moment.
Colonel Sanders pressed him further. "What does God look l ike, and
what does He do?"
" Don't ask me. God's God. He's everywhere, watching what we do, j udging whether it's good or bad."
" Sounds l ike a soccer referee."
"Sort of, I guess."
"So God wears shorts, has a wh istle sticking out of His mouth , and keeps
an eye on the clock?"
"You know that's not what I mean," Hosh ino said.
"Are the Japanese God and the foreign God relatives, or maybe enemies?"
"How should I know?"
"Listen - God only exists i n people's minds. Especially i n Japa n , God's
always been kind of a flexible concept. Look at what happened after the war.
Douglas MacArthur ordered the divine emperor to quit being God, and h e
d i d , making a speech saying he was j ust an ordinary person. So after 1946 h e
wasn't G o d anymore . That's what Japanese gods a r e l ike - they c a n be
tweaked and adj usted. Some American chomping on a cheap pipe gives
the order and presto c h a nge o God's no longer God. A very postmodern
kind of thing. If you th ink God's there, He is. If you don 't, He isn 't. And if
that's what God's l ike , I wouldn't worry about it."
-

"Okay . . . "
"Anyway, j ust get the stone out, would you? I'll take full responsibility. I
might not be a god or a Buddha, but I do have a few connections. I ' l l make
sure you aren't cursed."
"You sure?"
" I won't go back on my word."
Hoshino reached out and carefully, l ike he was inching out a landmine,
picked up the stone. "It's pretty heavy."
"Th is isn't tofu we 're dealing with . Stones tend to be heavy."
"But even for a stone it's heavy," Hoshino said. "So what do you want me
to do with it?"
"Take it home and put it next to your bed. After that thi ngs will take their
course."
"You want me to take it back to the inn?"
"You can take a cab if it's too heavy," Colonel Sanders repl ied.
"Yeah, but is it okay to take it so far away?"
"Listen, every object's in flux. The Earth , time, concepts, love , life , faith ,
j ustice, evil - they're all fluid and in transition . They don't stay in one form or
i n one place forever. The whole universe is l ike some big FedEx box."
"Hrn."
"This stone's temporarily there in the form of a stone. Moving it isn't
going to change anything."
"All right, but what's so special about this stone? I t doesn't look l ike much
of anything."
"The stone itself is meaningless. The situation calls for something, and at
this point in time it j ust happens to be this stone. Anton Chekhov put it best
when he said, 'If a pistol appears in a story, eventually it's got to be fired.'
Do you know what he means?"
"Nope."
Colonel Sanders sighed. "I didn't think so, but I had to ask. It's the polite
thing to do."
"Much obliged."
"What Chekhov was getting at is this: necessity is an independent con­
cept. It has a different structure from logic, morals, or meaning. Its function
l ies entirely in the role it plays. What doesn't play a role shouldn't exist. What
necessity requires does need to exist. That's what you call dramaturgy. Logi c ,
morals, or meaning don't have anything t o d o with i t . It's a l l a question of rela­
tional ity. Chekhov understood dramaturgy very well ."

"Whoa - you're way over my head."
"The stone you 're carrying there is Chekhov's pistol . It will have to be
fired. So in that sense it's important. But there's nothing sacred or holy about
it. So don't worry yourself about any curse."
Hoshino frowned. "This stone's a pistol?"
"Only in the metaphorical sense . Don't worry - bullets aren't about to
shoot out." Colonel Sanders took a huge furosh iki cloth from a pocket and
handed it to Hoshino. "Wrap it up in th is. Better for people not to see it."
" I told you it was steal ing! "
"Are you deaf? It's not stealing. We need it for someth ing i mportant, so
we're j ust borrowing it for a while."
"Okay, okay. 1 get it. Following the rules of dramaturgy, we're of necessity
moving matter."
"Precisely," Colonel said, nodding. "See, you do understand what I'm
talking about."
Carrying the stone wrapped in the navy blue cloth, Hosh ino followed the
path back out of the woods, Colonel Sanders lighting the way for him with
his flashl ight. The stone was much heavier than it looked and Hoshino had to
stop a few times to catch his breath . They quickly cut across the well-l it shrine
grounds so no one would see them, then came out on a main street. Colonel
Sanders hailed a cab and waited for Hoshino to climb i n with the stone.
"So 1 should put it next to my pillow, huh?" Hosh ino asked.
" Right," Colonel Sanders said. "That's all you have to do. Don't try any­
thing else. Just having it there's the main thing."
" I should thank you . For showing me where the stone was."
Colonel Sanders grinned. "No need - j ust doing my job. Just consummating my function. But hey - how 'bout that girl , Hosh ino?"
" She was amazing."
'Tm glad to hear it."
"She was real , right? Not a fox spirit or some abstraction or something
messed up l ike that?"
"No spirit, no abstraction. Just one real , l ive sex machine. Genuine four­
wheel-drive l ust. It wasn't easy to find her. So rest assured ."
"Whew ! " Hoshino sighed.

By the time Hoshino laid the cloth-wrapped stone next to Nakata 's pillow it
was al ready past one a.m. He figured putting it next to Nakata 's pillow i nstead

of h i s own lessened the chance of any curse. As he'd imagined, Nakata was
stil l Ollt l ike the proverbial log. Hoshino untied the cloth so the stone was vis­
ible. He changed into his pajamas, crawled into the other futon , and instantly
fel l asleep. He had one short dream - of a god in short pants, hairy shins stick­
ing out, racing around a field playing a flute.
At five that morning, Nakata woke up and found the stone beside his
pillow.

Chapter 31

ust after one o'clock I take coffee up to the second-floor study. The door,
as always, is open. Miss Saeki 's standing by the window gaz ing outside,
one hand resting on the windowsill. Lost in thought, unaware that her
other hand's fingering the buttons on her blouse . Th is time there's no pen or
writing paper on the desk. I place the coffee cup on the desk. A th i n layer of
clouds covers the sky, and the birds outside are quiet for a change .
She finally notices me and, pulled back from her thoughts, comes away
from the window, sits down at the desk, and takes a sip of coffee. She motions
for me to sit i n the same chair as yesterday. I sit down and look at her across
the desk, sipping her coffee. Does she remember anything at all about what
happened last night? I can't tel l . She looks l ike she knows everythi ng, and at
the same time l ike she doesn't know a th ing. I mages of her naked body come
to mind, memories of how different parts felt. I'm not even sure that was the
body of the woman who's here i n front of me. At the time, though, I'm a hun­
dred percent sur e .
S h e h a s on a l ight green, silky-looking blouse a n d a tight beige skirt.
There's a th i n silver necklace at her throat, very chic. Like some neatly
crafted object, her slim fingers on the desk are beautifully intertwined . " S o,
do you l ike th is area now?" she asks me.
"Do you mean Takamatsu?"
"Yes.�'
" I don't know. I haven't seen much of it, j ust a few things along the way.
Th is l ibrary, of course, a gym, the station, the hotel . . . those kinds of places."
" Don't you find it boring?"
I shake my head . "I don't know yet. I haven't had time to get bored, and
cities look the same anyway. Why do you ask? Do you think it's a boring town?"
She gave a slight shrug. "When I was young I did. I was dying to get out.
To leave here and go someplace else, where something special was waiting,
where I could find more interesting people ."

J

"Interesting people?"
Miss Saeki shakes her head slightly. " I was young," she says. " Most young
people have that feeling, 1 suppose . Haven't you?"
"No, I never felt that if I go somewhere else there'll be special thi ngs
waiting for me. I j ust wanted to be somewhere else, that's all . Anywhere
but there."
"There?"
"Nogata, Nakano Ward. Where I was born and grew up."
At the sound of th is name something flashed across her eyes. At l east it
looked l ike it.
"As long as you left there, you didn't particularly care where you went?"
she asks .
"That's right," I say. "Where I went wasn't the issue. I had to get out of
there or else I knew I 'd get totally messed up. So I left."
She looks down at her hands resting on the desk, a very detached look in
her eyes. Then, very quietly, she says, "When 1 left here when I was twenty, I
felt the same way. I had to leave or else I wouldn't survive. And I was con­
vinced I 'd never see th is place again as long as I l ived. I never considered
coming back, but things happened and here I am. Like I'm starting all over
aga i n ." She turns around and looks out the window.
The clouds covering the sky are the same tone as before, and there isn't
any wind to speak of. The whole thing looks as still as the painted background
.
scenery 111 a movie.
" Incredible th ings happen in life," she says.
"You mean I might go back to whcre I started?"
" I don't know. That's up to you, sometime well i n the future. But I th ink
where a person is born and dies is very important. You can't choose where
you're born , but where you die you can - to some degree." She says all this in
a quiet voice, staring out the window l ike she's talking to some imaginary
person outside. Remembering I'm here, she turns toward me. "I wonder why
I'm confessing all these things to you ."
"Because I'm not from around here, and our ages are so different."
" I suppose so," she says.
For twenty, maybe thirty seconds, we're lost in our own thoughts . She
picks up her cup and takes another sip of coffee.
I decide to come right out and say it. "Miss Saeki , I have something I
need to confess, too."
She looks at me and smiles. "We're exchanging secrets, I see."
.

"Mine isn't a secret. Just a theory."
"A theory?" she repeats. "You're confessing a theory?"
"Yes,"
"Sounds interesting."
"It's a sequel to what we're talking about," I say. "What I mean is, did you
come back to this town to die?"
Like a silvery moon at dawn, a smile rises to her lips. " Perhaps I did. But
it doesn't seem to matter. Whether you come to a place to l ive or to die, the
th ings you do every day are about the same."
"Are you hoping to die?"
" I wonder . . . ," she says . "I don't know myself."
"My father was hoping to die ."
"Your father died?"
"Not long ago," I tell her. "Very recently, in fact."
"Why was your father trying to die?"
I take a deep breath . "For a long time I couldn't figure it out. But now I
th ink I have. After coming here I finally understand."
"Why?"
"My father was i n love with you, but couldn't get you back. Or maybe
from the very beginning he couldn't really make you his. He knew that, and
that's why he wanted to die. And that's also why he wanted his son - your son,
too - to murder h i m . Me, in other words. He wanted me to sleep with you
and my older s ister, too . That was his prophecy, his curse . He programmed all
this inside me."
Miss Saeki returns her coffee cup to the saucer with a hard, neutral
sound. She looks straight at me, but she's not really seeing me. She's gazing at
some void, some blank space somewhere else. "Do I know your father?"
I shake my head. "As I told you , it's just a theory."
She rests her hands on the desk, one on top of the other. Faint traces of a
smile remai n . " I n your theory, then, I'm your mother."
"That's right," I say. "You l ived with my father, had me, and then went
away, leaving me beh ind. In the summer when I 'd j ust turned four."
"So that's your theory."
I nod .
"Which explains why you asked me yesterday whether I have any children?"
Again I nod.
"I told you I couldn't answer that. Couldn't give you a yes or a no."
"I know."

" S o your theory remains speculative ."
I nod again. "That's right."
"So tell me, how did your father die?"
"He was murdered."
"You didn't murder him, did you?"
"No, I didn't. I have an alibi."
"But you're not entirely sure?"
I shake my head. 'Tm not sure at all."
She lifts the coffee cup again and takes a tiny sip, as if it has no taste .
"Why did your father put you under that curse?"
"He must've wanted me to take over his will," I say.
''To desire me, you mean."
"That's right," I say.
Miss Saeki stares into the cup in her hand, then looks up again.
"So do you - desire me?"
I give one clear nod .
She closes her eyes. I gaze at her closed eyel ids for a long time, and
through them I can see the darkness that she's seeing. Odd shapes loom up in
it, floating up only to disappear.
Finally she opens her eyes. "You mean in theory you desire me."
"No, apart from the theory. I want you , and that goes way beyond any
theory."
"You want to have sex with me?"
I nod.
She narrows her eyes l ike somethi ng's shining i n them. "Have you ever
had sex with a girl before?"
I nod again. Last night with YOll , I think. But I can't say it out loud. She
doesn't remember a thing.
Something close to a sigh escapes her l ips . " Kafka, I know you realize
th is, but you're fifteen and I'm over fifty."
"It's not that simple. We're not talking about that sort of time here. I know
you when you were fifteen . And I'm in love with you at that age . Very much
i n love . And through her, I'm in love with you. That young girl's still inside
you , asleep inside you . Once Y O ll go to sleep, though , she comes to life . I 've
seen it."
She closes her eyes once more, her eyelids trembl ing slightly.
'Tm in love with you , and that's what's important. I th ink you under­
stand that."
Like someone rising to the surface of the sea from deep below, she takes
-

a deep breath . She searches for the words to say, but they l i e beyond her
grasp. 'Tm sorry, Kafka, but would you mind leaving? I 'd l ike to be alone for
a while," she says. "And close the door on your way out."
I nod, stand up, and start to go, but someth ing pulls me back. I stop at the
door, turn around, and walk across the room to where she is. I reach out and
touch her hair. Through the strands my hand brushes her small ear. I j ust
can't help it.
Miss Saeki looks up, surprised , and after a moment's hesitation lays her
hand on mine. "At any rate, you - and your theory - are throwing a stone at a
target that's very far away. Do you understand that?"
I nod . " I know. But metaphors can reduce the distance."
"We're not metaphors."
" I know," I say. "But metaphors help eliminate what separates you
and me."
A faint smile comes to her as she looks up at me. "That's the oddest
pickup line I 've ever heard."
"There're a lot of odd th ings going on - but I feel l ike I'm slowly getting
closer to the truth."
"Actually getting closer to a metaphorical truth ? Or metaphorically
getting closer to an actual truth ? Or maybe they supplement each other?"
"Either way, I don't th ink I can stand the sadness I feel right now," I
tell her.
"I feel the same way."
"So you did come back to th is town to die."
She shakes her head. "To be honest about it, I'm not trying to die. I'm j ust
waiting for death to come. Like sitting on a bench at the station, waiting for
the tra i n ."
"And do you know when the train's going to arrive?"
She takes her hand away from mine and touches her eyelids with the tips
of her fingers. " Kafka, I 've worn away so much of my own l ife, worn myself
away. At a certain point I should have stopped l iving, but didn't. I knew life
was pointless, but I couldn't give up on it. So I ended up j ust marking time,
wasting my l i fe i n pointless pursuits . I wound up hurting myself, and that
made me hurt others around me. That's why I'm being punished n ow, why
I'm under a kind of curse. I had something too complete , too perfect, once,
and afterward all I could do was despise myself. That's the curse I can never
escape . So I'm not afraid of death . And to answer your question - yes, I have
a pretty good idea of when the time is coming."
Once more I take her hand i n mine. The scales are shaking, and j ust a

tiny weight would send them tipping to one side or the other. I have to th ink.
I have to decide. I have to take a step forward. "Miss Saeki , would you sleep
with me?" I ask.
"You mean even if I were your mother in that theory of yours?"
"It's l ike everything around me's in flux - l ike it all has a doubled
meaning."
She ponders this. "That might not be true for me, though . For me, things
might not be so nuanced. It might be more l ike all or noth ing."
"And you know which it is."
She nods.
"Do you mind if I ask you a question?"
"About what?"
"Where did you come up with those two chords?"
"Chords?"
"The ones in the bridge in 'Kafka on the Shore.' "
She looks at me. "You l ike them?"
I nod.
" I found those chords in an old room, very far away. The door to the
room was open then," she says quietly. "A room that was far, far away." She
closes her eyes and sinks back into memories. " Kafka, close the door when
you leave," she says .
And that's exactly what I do.
After we close up the l ibrary for the night, Oshima drives me to a seafood
restaurant a little way away. Through a large window in the restaurant we can
see the night sea, and I think about all the creatures l iving under the water.
" Sometimes you've got to get out and eat some decent food ," he tells m e .
"Relax. I don't think the cops have staked the place out. We both needed a
change of scenery."
We eat a huge salad, and split an order of paella.
'Td love to go to Spain someday," Oshima says.
"Why Spain?"
"To fight in the Spanish C ivil War."
"But that ended a long time ago."
"I know that. Lorca died, and Hemingway survived," Oshima says. "But I
stil l have the right to go to Spain and be a part of the Spanish C ivil War."
"Metaphorically."
"Exactly," he says, giving me a wry look. "A hemoph iliac of undeter­
mined sex who's hardly ever set foot outside Sh ikoku isn't about to actually go
off to fight in Spain, I would think."

We attack the mound of paella, wash ing it down with Perrier.
"Have there been any developments in my father's case? " I ask.
" Nothing to report, really. Except for a typical smug memorial piece in
the arts section, there hasn't been much in the papers. The i nvestigation must
be stuck. The sad fact is the arrest rate's been going down steadily these
days - j ust l ike the stock market. I mean, the pol ice can't even track down the
son who's disappeared."
'The fifteen-year-old youth ."
" Fifteen, with a history of violent behavior," Oshima adds. "The obsessed
young runaway."
"How about that incident with th ings falling from the sky?"
Oshima shakes his head. "They're taking a break on that one. Noth ing
else weird has fallen from the sky - unless you count that award-winning
l ightning we had two days ago."
"So thi ngs have settled down?"
"It seems l ike it. Or maybe we're j ust in the eye of the storm."
I nod, pick up a clam, yank out the meat with a fork, then put the shell on
a plate full of empty shells.
"Are you still in love?" Oshima asks me.
I nod. "How about you?"
"Am I in love, do you mean?"
I nod aga i n .
"In other words, you're daring to get personal and ask about the anti­
social romance that colors my warped, homosexual, Gender-Identity­
Disordered life?"
I nod, and he follows suit.
" I have a partner, yes," he admits. He makes a serious face and eats a
clam. "It's not the kind of passionate, stormy love you find i n a Puccini
opera or anyth ing. We keep a careful distance from each other. We don't
get together that often, but we do understand each other at a deep, basic
level."
" U nderstand each other?"
"Whenever Haydn composed, he always made sure to dress formally,
even to wearing a powdered wig."
I look at him in surprise. "What's Haydn got to do with anything?"
"He couldn't compose well unless he did that."
"How come?"
" I have no idea. That's between Haydn and his wig. Nobody else would
understand. Inexpl icable, I imagine."

I nod. "Tell me, when you·re alone do you sometimes th ink about your
partner and feel sad?"
"Of course," he says . "It happens sometimes. When the moon turns blue,
when birds fly south , when - "
"Why of course?" I ask.
"Anyone who falls in love is searching for the missing pieces of them­
selves. So anyone who's in love gets sad when they think of their lover. It's
l ike stepping back inside a room YOll have fond memories of, one you haven't
seen in a long time. It's j ust a natural feeling. You're not the person who dis­
covered that feeling, so don't go trying to patent it, okay?"
I lay my fork down and look up.
"A fond, old, faraway room?"
"Exactly," Oshima says. He holds his fork straight up for emphasis. "Just a
metaphor, of course ."

Miss Saeki comes to my room after nine that night. I ' m sitting at the desk
reading a book when I hear her Golf pull i nto the parking lot. The door slams
shut. Rubber-soled shoes slowly crunch across the parking lot. And finally
there's a knock at my door. I open the door, and there she is. Th is time she's
wide awake. She has on a pinstriped silk blollse, th in blue j eans, white deck
shoes. I 've never seen her in pants before.
" I haven't seen this room in a long time," she says. She stands by the wall
and looks at the painting. "Or this picture, either."
"Is the place in the painting around here?" I ask.
"Do you like it?"
I nod. "Who painted it?"
"A young artist who boarded that slimmer with the Komuras," she says .
"He wasn't very famous, at least at the time. I 've forgotten his name. He was a
very friendly person, though , and I think he did a good j ob with the painting.
There's something, I don't know - po we rfu l about it. I sat beside him the
whole time and watched him work. I made all kinds of half-joking sugges­
tions as he painted. We got along well. It was a slimmer a long time ago. I was
twelve then. The boy in the painting was twelve, too."
"It looks l ike the sea around here."
"Let's go for a walk," she says . ''I'll take you there ."
I walk with her to the shore. We cut through a pine forest and walk down
the sandy beach. The clouds are breaking lip and a half moon shines down
on the waves. Small waves that barely reach the shore, barely break. S h e

sits down at a spot on the sand, and 1 sit down next to her. The sand's still
faintly warm .
Like she's checking the angle, she points to a spot on the shoreline. "It
was right over there," she says. "He painted that spot from here. H e put the
deck chair over there, had the boy pose in it, and set up his easel right around
here. I remember it wel l . Do you notice how the position of the island is the
same as i n the painting?"
I follow where she's pointing, and sure enough it's the same . No matter
how long I gaze at it, though , it doesn 't look l ike the place in the painting.
I tell her that.
"It's changed completely," Miss Saeki repl ies. "That was forty years ago,
after all . Th ings change . A lot of th ings affect the shoreline - waves, wind,
typhoons. Sand gets washed away, they truck more in. But this is definitely
the spot. 1 remember what occurred there very well . That was the summer
I had my first period, too."
We sit there looking at the scenery. The clouds shift and the moonl ight
dapples the sea. Wind blows through the pine forest, sounding l ike a crowd of
people sweeping the ground at the same time. I scoop lip some sand and let it
slowly spill out between my fingers . It falls to the beach and, l ike lost time,
becomes part of what's already there . I do this over and over.
"What are you thinking about?" Miss Saeki asks me.
"About going to Spain," I reply.
" What are you going to do there?"
"Eat some delicious paella."
"That's all?"
"And fight i n the Spanish C ivil War."
"That ended over sixty years ago."
" I know," I tell her. "Lorca died, and Hemingway survived."
"But you want to be a part of it."
I nod. "Yup. Blow up bridges and stuff."
"And fall in love with I ngrid Bergman ."
"But in reality I'm here in Takamatsu. And I'm in love with you . "
'Tough luck."
I put my arm around her.
You put your arm around her.
She leans against you . And a long spell of time passes.
"Did you knO\v that I did th is exact same th ing a long time ago? Right in
th is same spot? "
"I know," you tell her.

" How do you know that?' Miss Saeki asks, and looks you i n the eyes.
" I was there then."
"Blowing up bridges?"
"Yes, 1 was there, blowing up bridges."
"Metaphorically."
"Of course."
You hold her in your arms, draw her close , kiss her. You can feel the
strength deserting her body.
"We're all dreaming, aren't we?" she says .
All of us are dreaming.
"Why did you have to die?"
" I couldn't help it," you reply.
Together you walk along the beach back to the l ibrary. You turn off the
l ight in your room , draw the curtains, and without another word climb into
bed and make love . Pretty much the same sort of lovemaking as the night
before. But with two differences. After sex, she starts to cry. That's one. She
buries her face i n the pillow and silently weeps. You don't know what to do.
You gently lay a hand on her bare shoulder. You know you should say some­
thing, but don't have any idea what. Words have all died in the hollow of
time, piling lip soundlessly at the dark bottom of a volcanic lake . And this
time as she leaves you can hear the engine of her car. That's number two . She
starts the engine, turns it off for a time, l ike she's thinking about someth i ng,
then turns the key again and drives out of the parking lot. That blank, silent
i nterval between leaves you sad, so terribly sad. Like fog from the sea, that
blankness wends its way into your heart and remains there for a long, long
time. Finally it's a part of you .
She leaves behind a damp pillow, wet with her tears. You touch the
warmth with your hand and watch the sky outside gradually l ighten. Far away
a crow caws . The Earth slowly keeps on turning. But beyond any of those
details of the real, there are dreams. And everyone's l iving i n them.

Chapter 32

hen Nakata woke up at five a.m. he saw the big stone right next to
his pillow. Hoshino was still sound asleep on the futon next to
his, mouth half open, hair sticking every wh ich way, Chunichi
Dragons cap tossed beside h i m . His sleeping face had a determined no­
matter-what-don't-dare-wake-me-up look to it.
Nakata wasn't particularly surprised to find the stone there. His mind
adapted immediately to the new real ity, accepted it, didn't question why it
happened to be there . Figuring out cause and effect was never his strong suit.
He sat down formally beside his bed, legs tucked neatly under him, and
spent some quality time with the stone, gazing i ntently at it. Finally he
reached out and, l ike he was stroking a large , sleeping cat, touched it. At first
gingerly, with only his fingertips, and when that seemed safe he ran his entire
hand carefully over the whole surface. All the while he rubbed it, he was
thinking - or at least had the pensive look of someone thinking. As if reading
a map, he ran his hand over every part of the stone, memorizing every bump
and cranny, getting a sol id sense of it. Then he suddenly reached up and
rubbed his short hair, search ing, perhaps, for the correlation between the
stone and his own head.
Finally he gave what might have been a sigh , stood up, opened the win­
dow, and stuck his face out. All that was visible was the rear of the building
next door. A shabby, miserable sort of building. The kind where shabby
people spend one shabby day after another doing their shabby work. The kind
of fallen-from-grace sort of building you find in any city, the kind Charles
Dickens could spend ten pages describing. The clouds floating above the
building were l ike hard clumps of dirt from a vacuum cleaner no one ever
cleaned. Or maybe more l ike all the contradictions of the Thi rd Industrial
Revolution condensed and set afloat in the sky. Regardless, it was going
to rain soon. Nakata looked down and spied a skinny black cat, tail alert,

W

patroll i ng the top of a narrow wall between the two buildings. ''There's going
to be l ightning today," he called out. But the cat didn't appear to hear h i m ,
didn't even turn around, j ust continued its languid walk a n d disappeared in
the shadows of the building.
Nakata set off down the hall, plastic bag with toilet kit inside i n hand, to
the communal sinks. He washed his face, brushed his teeth , and shaved with
a safety razor. Each operation took time. He carefully washed his face, taking
his time, carefully brushed his teeth, taking his time, carefully shaved, taking
his time. He trimmed his nose hairs with a pair of scissors, straightened up his
eyebrows, cleaned out his ears. He was the type who took his time no matter
what he did, but this morning he took everything at an even slower pace than
usual. No one else was up wash ing his face at th is early hour, and it was still a
while before breakfast was ready. Hoshino didn't look l ike he'd be getting up
anytime soon. With the whole place to himself, Nakata looked i n the mirror,
leisurely preparing for the day, and pictured the faces of all the cats he'd seen
in the book in the l ibrary two days before. Unable to read, he didn't know the
names of the cats, but a clear picture of each and every eat's face was etched
in his memory.
"There really are a lot of cats in the world, that's for sur e ," he said as he
cleaned out his ears with a Q-tip. His first-ever visit to a l ibrary had made him
painfully aware of how little he knew. The amount of th ings he didn't know
about the world was infinite. The infinite , by definition, has no l imits, and
thinking about it gave him a mild migraine. He gave up and turned his
thoughts back to Cats of the World. How nice it would be, he thought, to be
able to talk with each and every cat in there. There must be all kinds of cats
in the world, all with different ways of th inking and talking. Would foreign
cats speak in foreign languages? he wondered. But th is was another difficult
subj ect, and again his head began to throb.
After wash ing up, he went to the toilet and took care of business as usual .
This didn't take as long as his other ablutions. Finished, he took his plastic
bag with the toilet kit inside back to the room . Hoshino was sound asleep,
exactly as he'd left him. Nakata picked up the discarded aloha shirt and jeans,
folding them up neatly. He set them down on top of each other next to
Hoshi no's futon , adding the Chunichi Dragons baseball cap on top l ike a
summary title given to a motley collection of ideas. He took off his yukata
robe and put on his usual trousers and shirt, then rubbed his hands together
and took a deep breath .
He sat down again i n front of the stone, gaz ing at it for a wh ile before
hesitantly reaching out to touch it. "There's going to be thunder today," he

pronounced to no one in particular. He may have been addressing the stone .
He punctuated this with a couple o f nods.

Nakata was over next to the window, running through an exercise routine,
when Hosh ino finally woke up. Humming the radio exercise music qu ietly to
himself, Nakata moved in time to the tune.
Hosh ino squinted at his watch. It was j ust after eight. He craned his neck
to make sure the stone was where he'd put it. In the l ight the stone looked
much bigger and rougher than he'd remembered. "So I wasn't dreaming after
all," he said.
"I'm sorry - what did you say?" Nakata asked.
"The stone," Hoshino said. "The stone's right there. It wasn't a dream . "
" We have t h e stone," Nakata s a i d simply, still i n the midst of his exercises,
making it sound l ike some central proposition of nineteenth-century German
philosophy.
"It's a long story, though, Gramps, about how the stone got to be there."
"Yes, Nakata thought that might be the case."
"Anyway," Hosh ino said, sitting up in bed and sighing deeply. "It doesn't
matter. The important th ing is it's here. To make a long story short."
"We have the stone," Nakata repeated. "That's what matters."
Hosh ino was about to respond but suddenly noticed how famished he
was. " Hey, what d'ya say we grab some breakfast?"
"Nakata's quite hungry."

After breakfast, as he was drinking tea, Hosh ino said, "So what are you going
to do with the stone?"
"What should Nakata do with it?"
"Gimme a break," Hoshino said, shaki ng his head. "You said you had to
find that stone, so that's why I managed to come up with it last night. Don't
hit me now with this Gee whiz, what should I do with it stuff. Okay?"
"Yes, you are right. But to tell the truth, I don't know yet what I'm sup­
posed to do with it."
"That's a problem."
"A problem indeed," Nakata repl ied, though you'd never know it from
his expression.
"So if you spend some time th inking about it, you'll figure out what
to do?"

" I think so. It takes Nakata much longer to do thi ngs than other people."
"Okay, but listen here, Mr. Nakata."
"Yes, Mr. Hosh ino?"
" I don't know who gave it that name, but since it's called the entrance
stone I ' m guessing it's gotta be the entrance to something a long time ago,
don't you think? There must be some legend or explanation about it."
"Yes, that must be the case."
"But you have no idea what kind of entrance we're talking about here?"
"No, not yet. I used to talk with cats all the time, but I 've never spoken
to a stone."
"Doesn't sound l ike it'd be too easy."
"It's very different from talking with a cat."
"But still , ripping that stone off from a shrine - you sure we won't be
cursed or something? That's really bothering me. Taking it's one thing, but
dealing with it now that we have it could be a total pain in the butt. Colonel
Sanders told me there wouldn't be any curse, but I can't totally trust the guy,
YOll know what I mean?"
"Colonel Sanders?"
"There's an old guy by that name. The guy on the Kentucky Fried
Chicken ads. With the white suit, beard, stupid glasses. You don't know who
I mean?"
'Tm very sorry, but I don't believe I know that person."
"You don't know Kentucky Fried Chicken? That's kind of unusual. Wel l ,
whatever. T h e o l d guy's an abstract concept anyway. He's n o t h u m a n , n o t a
god or a Buddha. He doesn't have any shape, but has to take on some sort of
appearance, so he j ust happened to choose the Colonel."
Nakata looked perplexed and rubbed his salt-and-pepper hair. " I don't
understand."
"Well, to tell you the truth , I don't get it either, though I ' m the one spout­
ing off," Hoshino said. "Anyhow, this weird olel guy suddenly pops up out of
nowhere and rattles off all those th ings to me. Long story short, the old guy
helped me out so I could locate the stone, and I lugged i t back here. I 'm not
trying to win your sympathy or anything, but it was a long, hard night, I can
tell you . What I 'd really l ike to do right now is hand the whole th ing to you
and let you take over."
"I will."
"That was quick."
"Mr. Hosh ino?" Nakata said.
"What?"

"There's going to be a lot of thunder soon. Let's wait for that."
"You're telling me the thunder's going to do something to help with
the stone?"
"I don't know for sure, but I'm starting to get that feeling."
"Thunder, huh? Sounds kind of cool . Okay, we'll wait and see what
happens."
When they got back to their room Hoshino flopped facedown on the
futon and switched on the TV. Noth ing was on except a bunch of variety
shows targeted at housewives, but since there was no other way of killing
time, he kept watching, giving a running critique of everyth ing on the screen.
Nakata, meanwhile, sat in front of the stone, gazing at it, rubbing it, occa­
sionally mumbling. Hoshino couldn't catch what he was saying. For all he
knew the old man might actually be talking to the stone.
After a couple of hours, Hoshino ran out to a nearby convenience store
and came back with a sack full of milk and sweet rolls the two of them had for
lunch. While they were eating, the maid showed up to clean the room, but
Hosh ino told her not to bother, they were fine.
"You're not going out anywhere?" she asked.
"Nope," he answered. "We've got something to do here."
"Because there's going to be thunder," Nakata added .
"Thunder. 1 see . . . ," the maid said dubiously before she l eft, looking
l ike she'd rather not have anything more to do with this weird pair.
Around noon thunder rumbled dully off in the distance, and, as if wait­
ing for a signal, it started sprinkl ing. Unimpressive thunder, a lazy dwarf
trampling on a dru m . Before long, though, the raindrops grew larger, and it
was soon a regular downpour, wrapping the world i n a wet, stuffy smell.
Once the thunder started, the two sat down across from each other, the
stone between them, l ike Indians passing a peace pipe. Nakata was still
mumbling to h i mself, rubbing the stone or his head. Hoshino puffed on a
Marlboro and watched.
"Mr. Hoshino?" Nakata said.
"What's up?"
"Would you stay with me for a wh ile?"
" S ure . I ' m not going anywhere in this rai n ."
"There's a chance something strange might happen."
"Are you kidding me?" Hoshino began. " Everything's been strange
enough already."
"Mr. Hoshino?"
"Yeah ."

"All of a sudden I was wondering - what am I , anyway? What is Nakata?"
Hosh ino pondered this. "That's a tough one. A little out of left field. I
mean, I don't even know what I am, so I'm not the guy to ask. Th inking isn't
exactly my th ing, you know? But I know you're an okay, honest guy. You're
Ollt of kilter big-time, but you're somebody I trust. That's why I came with
you all the way to Sh ikoku . I may not be so bright, either, but I do have an eye
for people."
"Mr. Hoshino?"
"Yeah?"
"It's not j ust that I'm dumb. Nakata's empty inside. I finally understand
that. Nakata's l ike a l ibrary without a single book. It wasn't always l ike that. I
used to have books inside me. For a long time I couldn't remember, but now
I can. I used to be normal, just l ike everybody else. But something happened
and I ended up l ike a container with nothing inside."
"Yeah , but if you look at it l ike that we're all pretty much empty, don't you
th ink? You eat, take a dump, do your crummy job for your lousy pay, and get
laid occasionally, if you're lucky. What else is there? Sti l l , you know, interest­
ing thi ngs do happen in life - like with us now. I'm not sure why. My grandpa
used to say that thi ngs never work out l ike you th ink they will, but that's what
makes l ife interesting, and that makes sense. If the Chunichi Dragons won
every single game, who'd ever watch baseball?"
"You l iked your grandfather a lot, didn't you?"
"Yeah, I did. If it hadn't been for him I don't know what would've hap­
pened to me. He made me feel l ike I should try and make someth i ng of
myself. He made me feel - I don't know -connected. That's why I quit the
motorcycle gang and joined the Self-Defense Force. Before I knew it, I wasn't
getting in trouble anymore."
"But you know, Mr. Hoshino, Nakata doesn't have anybody. Nothing.
I'm not connected at all. I can't read. And my shadow's only half of what it
should be."
"Everybody has their shortcomings."
"Mr. Hoshino?"
"Yeah?"
"If I 'd been my normal self, I think I would've l ived a very different kind
of life . Like my two younger brothers. I would have gone to college , worked
in a company, gotten married and had a family, driven a big car, played golf
on my days off. But I wasn't normal, so that's why I'm the Nakata I am today.
It's too late to do it over. I understand that. But still, even for a short time, I 'eI

l ike to be a normal Nakata . Up until now there was never anyth ing i n partic­
ular I wanted to do. I always did what people told me as best I could. Maybe
that j ust became a habit. But now I want to go back to being normal. I want to
be a Nakata with his own ideas, his own meaning."
Hoshino sighed. "If that's what you want, then go for it. Not that I have a
clue what a normal Nakata's l ike."
"Nakata doesn't either."
"I j ust hope it works out. I'll be praying for you - that you can be normal
again."
"Before I get back to being normal, though , there are some th i ngs I have
to take care of."
"Like what?"
"Like Johnnie Walker."
"Johnnie Walker?" Hoshino said. "Yeah , you mentioned that before .
You mean the whisky guy?"
"Yes. I went to the pol ice right away, and told them about h i m . I knew I
had to report to the Governor, but they wouldn't l isten. So I have to find a
solution 0 11 my own . I have to take care of that before I can be a normal
Nakata again. If that's possible."
"I don't really get it, but I guess you're saying you need th is stone to do
whatever it is you need to do."
"That's right. I have to get the other half of my shadow back."
By th is time the thunder was deafening. Lightning zigzagged across the
sky, followed, a moment later, by the roar of thunder. The air shook, and the
loose windowpanes rattled nervously. Dark clouds capped the whole sky, and
it got so dark inside they could barely make out each other's faces. They left
the l ight off, however. They were still seated as before , with the stone between
them. The rain was lashing down so hard it felt suffocating j ust to look at it.
Each flash of l ightning lit up the room for an instant. They didn't say any­
thing for a while.
"Okay, but why do you have to have anyth ing to do with th is stone,
Mr. Nakata?" Hoshino asked when the thunder had died down a bit. "Why
does it have to be you ?"
"Because I'm the one who's gone in and come out aga i n ."
"I don't follow you."
"I left here once, and came back again. It happened when Japan was i n a
big war. The lid came open, and I left here. By chance I came back. That's
why I ' m not normal, and my shadow's only half of what it was . But then I

could talk with cats, though I can't do it well anymore . I can also make things
fal l from the sky."
"Like those leeches?"
"Yes."
"A pretty unique talent, that's for sure."
"That's right, not everybody can do it."
"And that's because you went out and came back again? I guess you
really a r e pretty extraordinary."
"After I came back I wasn't normal anymore . I couldn't read . And I 've
never touched a woman."
"That's hard to believe ."
"Mr. Hoshino?"
"Yeah?"
'Tm scared. As I told you , I'm completely empty. Do you know what it
means to be completely empty?"
Hoshino shook his head. " I guess not."
"Being empty is l ike a vacant house . An unlocked, vacant house . Any­
body can come in, anytime they want. That's what scares me the most. I can
make things rai n from the sky, but most of the time I don't have any idea what
I'm going to make rain next. If it were ten thousand knives, or a huge bomb,
or poison gas - I don't know what I 'd do . . . . I could say I'm sorry to every­
body, but that wouldn't be enough ."
"You got that right," Hoshino said. "Just apologizing wouldn't cut it.
Leeches are bad enough , but those things are even worse."
"Johnnie Walker went inside Nakata. He made me do things I didn't
want to. Johnnie Walker used me, but I didn't have the strength to fight it.
Because I don't have anything inside me."
"Which explains why you want to go back to being a normal Nakata.
One with substance?"
"That's exactly right. I'm not very bright, but I could build furniture, and
I did it day after day. I l iked making things - desks, chairs, chests. It's nice to
make things with nice shapes. Those years I made furniture, I never thought
about wanting to be normal again. And there wasn't anyone I knew who tried
to get inside me. Nakata never felt afraid of anything. But after meeting
Johnnie Walker I got very afraid."
"So what did this Johnnie Walker make you do after he got inside you?"
A loud rumble ripped through the sky, and the l ightning was close by, by
the sound of it. Hoshino's eardrums were stinging from the roar.

286

Nakata inclined his head slightly to one side, listening carefully, slowly
rubbing the surface of the stone all the while."He made me shed blood."
"Blood?"
"Yes, but it didn't stick to Nakata's hands."
Hoshino pondered this for a while, puzzled. "Anyway, once you open
the entrance stone, all sorts of things will naturally settle back where they're
meant to be, right?Like water flowing from high places to low places?"
Nakata considered this. "It might not be that easy. Nakata's job is to
find the entrance stone, and open it. What happens after that, I'm afraid I
don't know."
"Okay, but why's the stone in Shikoku?"
"The stone is everywhere. Not just in Shikoku.And it doesn't have to be
a stone."
"I don't get it....If it's everywhere, then you could've done all this back
home in Nakano.That would've saved a lot of time and effort."
Nakata rubbed a palm over his close-cropped hair. "That's a hard ques­
tion.I've been listening to the stone for a while now but can't understand it
all that well yet.But I do think both of us had to come here.We had to cross
a big bridge.It wouldn't have worked in Nakano Ward."
"Can I ask you something else?"
"Yes,"
"If you do open the entrance stone here, is something amazing going to
happen?Like is what's-his-name, that genie, going to pop out like in Aladdin?
Or a prince that's been turned into a frog will French-kiss me?Or else we'll
be eaten alive by Martians?"
"Something might happen, but then again maybe nothing. I haven't
opened it yet, so I don't know.You can't know until you open it."
"But it might be dangerous, huh?"
"Yes, exactly."
"Jeez." Hoshino pulled a Marlboro out of his pocket and lit it. "My
grandpa used to always tell me that my bad point was running off with people
I didn't know without thinking what I was doing.I guess I must have always
done that. The child's the father of the man, like they say. Anyhow, there's
nothing I can do about it now. I've come all this way, and gone to all the
trouble of locating the stone, so I can't just head on home without seeing it
through.We know it might be dangerous, but what the hell. Why elon't we
open it up anel see what happens? At least it'll make a great story for the
grandkids."

"Nakata has a favor to ask you, Mr.Hoshino."
"What's that?"
"Could you pick up the stone?"
"No problem."
"It's a lot heavier than when you brought it."
"I know I'm no Schwarzenegger, but I'm stronger than I look. In the
SDF I got second place in our unit's arm-wrestling contest. Plus you've cured
my back problems, so I can give it everything I've got."
Hoshino stood up, grabbed the stone in both hands, and tried to lift it.
The stone didn't budge an inch. "You're right, it is a lot heavier, " he said,
gasping."A while ago, lifting it up was no problem.Now it feels like it's nailed
to the floor."
"It's the valuable entrance stone, so it can't be moved easily.If it could,
that would be a problem."
"I suppose so."
Right then a few irregular flashes of light ripped through the sky, and a
series of thunderclaps shook the earth to its core. It's like somebody just
opened the lid to hell, Hoshino thought.One final clap of thunder boomed
nearby and suddenly there was a thick, suffocating silence.The air was damp
and stagnant, with a hint of something suspicious, as if countless ears were
floating in the air, waiting to pick up a trace of some conspiracy. The two
men were frozen, wrapped in the midday darkness. Suddenly the wind
picked up again, lashing rain against the window.Thunder rumbled, but not
as violently as before.The center of the storm had passed the city.
Hoshino looked up and swept the room with his eyes. Everything seemed
strangely cold and distant, the four walls even more blank than before.The
Marlboro butt in the ashtray had turned to ash. He swallowed and brushed
the silence from his ears."Hey, Mr.Nakata?"
"What is it, Mr.Hoshino?"
"I feel like I'm having a bad dream."
"Well, at least we're having the same dream."
"You're right, " Hoshino said, and scratched his earlobe in resignation.
"Right you are, right as rain, rain rain go away, come again some other
day....Anyway, that makes me feel better." He then stood up once more, to
try to move the stone.He took a deep breath, grabbed it, and focused all his
strength in his hands.With a low grunt he managed to lift the stone an inch
or two.
"You moved it a little, " Nakata said.

288

"So we know it's not nailed down. But I've got to move it more than that,
I guess."
"You need to flip it completely over."
"Like a pancake."
Nakata nodded "That's right.Pancakes are one of Nakata's favorites."
"Clad to hear it.So they have pancakes in hell, huh?Anyway, let me give
it one more try.I think I can flip this thing over."
Hoshino closed his eyes and summoned up every ounce of strength, con­
centrating it on this one action.This is it! he told himself. Now or never!
He got a good grip, carefully tightened it, then took a huge breath, let out
a gut-wrenching yell, and all at once lifted the stone, holding it in the air at a
forty-five-degree angle.That was the limit of his strength.Somehow, he was
able to hold it in that position.He gasped, his whole body aching, his bones
and muscles and nerves screaming in pain, but he wasn't about to give up.He
took in one last deep breath and gave out a battle cry, but couldn't hear his
own voice.He had no idea what he was saying.Eyes shut tight, he managed
to drag out a strength he never knew he had, strength that should have been
beyond him.Lack of oxygen made everything go white.One after another his
nerves snapped like popping fuses.He couldn't see or hear a thing, or even
think.There wasn't enough air.Still, he inched the stone upward and, with a
final yell, tipped it over. He lost his grip, and the weight of the stone itself
flipped it over.A massive thud rattled the room as if the whole building was
shaking.
The recoil sent Hoshino tumbling backward. He lay there, sprawled
faceup on the tatami, gasping for air, his head filled with soft mud whirling
round and round.I don't think, he thought, I'll ever lift something this heavy
again as long as I live.(Later on, though, it turned out that this prediction was
overly optimistic.)
"Mr.Hoshino?"
"Wh-what?"
"The entrance opened up, thanks to you."
"You know something, Cramps?I mean, Mr.Nakata?"
"What is it?"
Faceup, eyes still shut, Hoshino took another long, deep breath and
exhaled."It better have opened up.Otherwise I killed myself for nothing."

Chapter 33

I

get the library all ready to open up before Oshima arrives.Vacuum all the
floors, wipe the windows, clean the restroom, wipe off all the chairs and
desks. Spray the banister, polish it up nicely. Carefully dust the stained

glass on the landing. Sweep the garden, switch on the AC in the reading
room and the storeroom's dehumidifier. Make coffee, sharpen pencils. A
deserted library in the morning-there's something about it that really gets to
me.All possible words and ideas are there, resting quietly.I want to do what I
can to preserve this place, keep it neat and tidy.Sometimes I come to a halt
and gaze at all the silent books on the stacks, reach out and touch the spines
of a few.At ten-thirty, as always, the Mazda Miata roars into the parking lot
and Oshima appears, looking a little sleepy.We chat for a while till it's time to
open up.
"If it's okay, I'd like to go out for a while, " I tell him right after we open up.
"Where to?"
"I need to go to the gym and work out.I haven't gotten any exercise for
a while."
That isn't the only reason.Miss Saeki comes in to work late in the morn­
ing, and I don't want to run into her. I need some time to get my head
together before I see her again.
Oshima looks at me and, after a pause, nods. "Watch out, though.I don't
want to henpeck you, but you can't be too careful, okay?"
"Don't worry, I'll be careful, " I assure him.
Backpack slung from one shoulder, I board the train. At Takamatsu
Station I take a bus to the fitness club.I change into my gym clothes in the
locker room, then do some circuit training, plugged into my Walkman,
Prince blasting away.It's been a while and my muscles complain, but I man­
age. It's the body's normal reaction-muscles screaming out, resisting the
extra burden put on them.Listening to "Little Red Corvette, " I try to soothe
that reaction, suppress it.I take a deep breath, hold it, exhale.Inhale, hold,

exhale. Even breathing, over and over. One by one I push my muscles to the
limit. I'm sweating like crazy, my shirt's soaked and heavy. I have to go over to
the cooler a few times to gulp down water.
I go through the machines in the usual order, my mind filled with Miss
Saeki. About the sex we had. I try to clear my head, blank everything out, but
it's not easy. I focus on my muscles, absorb myself in the routine. The same
machines as always, same weights, same number of reps. Prince is singing
"Sexy Motherfucker" now. The end of my penis is still a bit sore and stings a
little when I take a leak. The tip's red. My fresh-from-the-foreskin cock is still
plenty young and tender. Condensed sexual fantasies, Prince's slippery voice,
quotes from all kinds of books-the whole confused mess swirls around in my
brain, and my head feels like it's about to burst.

I take a shower, change into fresh underwear, and take the bus back to the
station. Hungry, I duck inside a diner and have a quick meal. As I'm eating I
realize this is where I ate on my first day in Takamatsu. Which gets me won­
dering how many days I've been here. It's been a week or so since I started
staying at the library, so I must have gotten to Shikoku about three weeks ago.
I have some tea after I'm finished eating and watch the people hustling
back and forth in front of the station. They're all headed somewhere. If I
wanted to, I could join them. Take a train to some other place. Throw away
everything here, head off somewhere I've never been, start from scratch. Like
turning a new page in a notebook. I could go to Hiroshima, Fukuoka, wher­
ever. Nothing's keeping me here. I'm one hundred percent free. Everything I
need to get by for a while is in my backpack. Clothes, toilet kit, sleeping bag.
I've hardly touched the cash I took from my father's study.
But I know I can't go anywhere.
"But you can't go anywhere, you know that very well," the boy named
Crow says.
You held Miss Saeki, came inside her so many times. And she took it
all. Your penis is still stinging, still remembering how it felt to be inside
her. One of the places that's just for you. You think of the library. The tran­
quil, silent books lining the stacks. You think of Oshima. Your room.

Kafka on the Shore hanging on the wall, the

fifteen-year-old girl gazing at

the painting. You shake your head. There's no way you can leave here. You
aren't free. But is that what you really want? To be free?

Inside the station I pass by patrolmen making their rounds, but they don't
pay me any mind. Seems like every other guy I pass is some tanned kid my

age shouldering a backpack. And I'm just one of them, melting into the
scenery.No need to get all jumpy.Just act natural, and nobody'll notice me.
I jump on the little two-car train and return to the library.
"Hey, you're back, " Oshima says. He looks at my backpack, dumb­
founded. " My word, do you always lug around so much luggage with you?
You're a regular Linus."
I boil some water and have a cup of tea.Oshima's twirling his lIsual long,
freshly sharpened pencil.Where his pencils wind up when they get too short
I have no idea.
"That backpack's like your symbol of freedom, " he comments.
"Guess so, " I say.
"Having an object that symbolizes freedom might make a person happier
than actually getting the freedom it represents."
"Sometimes, " I say.
"Sometimes, " he repeats."You know, if they had a contest for the world's
shortest replies, you'd win hands down."
"Perhaps."
"Perhaps, " Oshima says, as if fed up. "Perhaps most people in the world
aren't trying to be free, Kafka. They just think they are. It's all an illusion.
If they really were set free, most people would be in a real bind.You'd better
remember that. People actually prefer not being free."
"Including you?"
"Yeah.I prefer being unfree, too. Up to a point. Jean-Jacques Rousseau
defined civilization as when people build fences. A very perceptive obser­
vation.And it's true-all civilization is the product of a fenced-in lack of free­
dom.The Australian Aborigines are the exception, though.They managed to
maintain a fenceless civilization until the seventeenth century.They're dyed­
in-the-wool free.They go where they want, when they want, doing what they
want. Their lives are a literal journey. Walkabout is a perfect metaphor for
their lives.When the English came and built fences to pen in their cattle, the
Aborigines couldn't fathom it.And, ignorant to the end of the principle at
work, they were classified as dangerous and antisocial and were driven away,
to the outback. So I want you to be careful. The people who build high,
strong fences are the ones who survive the best.You deny that reality only at
the risk of being driven into the wilderness yourself."

I go back to my room and lay down my backpack.Next I head to the kitchen,
brew up some coffee, and take it to Miss Saeki's room. Metal tray in both

hands, 1 carefully walk up each step, the old floorboards creaking. On the
landing, 1 step through a rai nbow of brilliant colors from th e sta i n e d glass.
Miss Saeki's sitti ng at h e r desk, writing. 1 put down the coffe e c u p , and
she l ooks up and asks me to sit down in my usual chair. Today she has on a
cafe-au-lait-colored s h i rt over a black T-sh irt. Her hair's p i n n e d back, and
she's wearing a pair of small pearl earrings.
She doesn't say anyth ing for a wh ile. S h e 's looking over what she's j ust
written . Noth i n g i n her expression looks out of the ordinary. She sc rews on
the cap of h e r fo untain pen and lays it on top of her writing paper. She
spreads her fi ngers, checking for ink sta i n s . Sunday-afternoon sunl ight is
shining through th e window. Some body's outside i n the gard e n , talking.
"Mr. Osh i m a told me you went to the gym ," she says , studyi n g my fac e .
"That's right," 1 say.
"What kind of exercise do you do there ?"
" I use the machines and the free weights," 1 reply.
"Anyth ing else?"
1 shake my head.
" Kind of a lonely type of sport, isn't it?"
1 nod .
"I imagi n e you want to become stronger."
"You have to be strong to survive . Especially i n my case ."
" B ecause you 're all alone."
" Nobody's going to help m e . At least no one has up till n ow. S o 1 have to
make it o n my own .1 have to get stronger - l ike a stray crow. That's why I gave
myself th e name Kafka . That's what Kafka means in Czech, you know -crow."
" H m m ," she says, mildly impressed. " S o you 're C row."
"That's right," I say.
That's right, the boy named C row says .
"There must be a limit to that kind of lifestyl e , though," she says . "You
can't use that strength as a protective wall around you . There's always going to
be someth ing stronger that can overcome your fortress. At least in principle."
" S trength itself becomes your morality."
Miss Saeki smiles. "You catch on quickly."
"The strength I ' m looking for isn't the kind where you win or lose. I ' m
n o t after a wal l that'll repel power coming from outside. What I want i s the
kind of strength to be able to

absorb that outside power, to stand up to it. Th e

strength to qu ietly e n d ur e th i ngs - u nfai rness, misfortun e , sadness, mistakes,
misunderstandings."
" That's got to be the most difficult strength of all to make your own ."

293

" I know . . . . "
H e r smile deepens one degree . "You seem to know eve ryth ing."
I shake my head. "That's not true. I ' m only fiftee n , and th e re 're plenty of
th ings I don't know. I should know them, but I don 't. I don't know anyth ing
about you, for one th i ng."
She pi cks up the coffee cup and takes a sip. "There's noth i n g that you
have to know, noth i n g inside me you need to know."
"Do you remember my th eory?"
"Of course," she says . "But that's your theory, not mine. So I have n o
responsibil ity for i t , right?"
"Exactly. The person who comes up with the th eory i s the one who has to
prove it," I say. "Wh i c h leads me to a question."
"About?"
"You told me you 'd published a book about people who'd been struck by
l i ghtning."
''That's right."
"Is it still available?"
She shakes h e r head. "They didn't print that many copies to begin with .
It went out of print a long time ago, and I imagine any leftover copies were
destroyed. I don't even have a copy. Like I said before , nobody was inte rested."
"Why were you interested i n that topic?"
'Tm not sure . I guess there was someth ing symbolic about it. Or maybe I
j ust wanted to keep myself busy, so I set a goal that kept me running around
and my mind occupied . I can't recall now what the original motivation was . I
came up with the idea and j ust started researc h i n g it. I was a writer the n , with
n o money worri es and plenty of free time, so I could mostly do whatever
sparked my i nte rest. Once I got into it, th ough , the top i c itself was fascinat­
ing. Meeting all kinds of peopl e , hearing all kinds of stories. If it were n 't for
that pro j ect, I probably would've withdrawn even further fro m reality a n d
ended up compl etely isolated."
"When my father was young he worked as a caddy at a golf course and was
hit by l i ghtning. He was lucky to survive . The guy with him didn't make it."
"A lot of people are killed by l ightning on golf courses - big, wide-open
spac es, with almost nowhere to take shelter. And l ightning l oves golf clubs. Is
your father also named Tamura?"
"Yes, and I th ink h e was about your age ."
She shakes her head. " I don't remember anybody named Tamura .
didn't i nte rview anybody by that name."
I don't say anyth ing.

294

"That's part of you r th eory, isn't it? That your fathe r and I met while I was
research i n g the book, and as a result you were born ."
"Yes."
"Well, that puts an end to it, doesn't it? That never happe n e d . You r theo ry doesn't stand up."
"Not necessarily," I say.
"What do you mean? "
" B ecause I don't believe everyth ing you 're telling me."
"Why not?"
"We l l , you i m m ediately said you 'd n ever interviewed anybody called
Tamura without even giving it any thought. Twe n ty years i s a long time, and
you must've i n te rviewed quite a number of peopl e . I don't th ink you 'd be able
to recall so quickly whether one of them was or wasn't named Tamura."
She shakes her head and takes anoth er sip of coffe e . A fa i n t smile springs
to her lips. " Kafka, 1 -" She stops, looking for the right words.
I wait for h e r to find the m .
" I feel l ike th ings a r e starti ng t o change around me," she says .
" H ow s o ? "
" I c a n 't really say, but somethi ng's happening. The a i r pressure, the way
sounds reverberate , the reflection of l ight, how bodies move and time
passes - it's all transforming, bit by bit. It's l ike each small change is a drop
that's steadily b u ilding up into a stream." She picks up h e r black Mont Blanc
pen, looks at it, puts it back where it was, then l ooks stra ight at m e . "What
happened between us i n your room last night is probably part of that fl ow. I
don't know if what we did last night was right or not. But at the time I decided
not to force myself to j udge anyth ing. If the flow is th ere, I figured I 'd j ust let
it carry m e along where it wanted."
"Can I tell you what I th ink?"
"Go right ahead."
" I th ink you 're trying to make up for lost ti me."
She thi nks about it for a while. "You may be right," she says . "But how do
you know that?"
" B ecause I'm doing the same th ing."
"Making up for lost time?"
"Yes," I say. "A lot of th i ngs were stolen from my c h i l d h o o d . Lots of
important th ings. And n ow I have to get th em back."
"In order to keep on l iving."
I nod . " I have to . People need a place they can go back to . Th e re 's still
time to make it, I th ink. For me,

and for you ."
295

S h e c l oses her eyes, and tents her fi ngers on top of h e r desk. Like s h e 's
resigned to it, she opens her eyes aga in ."Who

are you ? " she asks."And why

do you know so much about everyth i ng?"
You tel l her she must know who you are.I'm Kafka o n the Shore, you say.
You r l over - and you r son.The boy named C row.And the two of us can't be
fre e .We're caught up in a whirlpool , pulled beyond tim e . Somewhere, we
were struck by l ightning.But not the kind of l ightning you can see or hear.
That night you make love aga in . You l isten as the blank with in her is
fi l l e d .I t's a fa int sound, l ike fine sand on a shore c rumblin g in the moon l ight.
You hold your breath , l istening.You 're inside your theory n ow.Th en you 're
outsid e .And ins ide again , then outside.You inhale, hold it, exhale. I n h a l e ,
hold it, exhale.Prince s ings on, l ike s o m e mollusk i n you r head.The m o o n
rises, t h e tide c o m e s i n .Seawater flows into a river.A branch of the dogwood
just outside the window tre mbles nervously.You hold her close, she buries
h e r face in your c hest.You feel her breath against you r bare skin . She traces
you r muscles, one by one. Finally, she gently l icks you r swollen penis , as if
h e a l ing it.You come aga i n , in her mouth . She swallows it down , as if every
drop is precious. You kiss her vagi na, touching every soft, warm spot with
you r tongue.You become someone else th ere,

something else.You are some­

where else.
"There's noth ing ins ide me you need to know," she says . Until Monday
morning dawns you hold each other, l istening to time passin g by.

Chapter 34

T

h e mass ive bank of th underclouds crossed the city at a lethargic pace,
l etting loose a fl urry of l i ghtning bolts as if prob ing every nook and
cranny for a long-lost morality, finally dwindling to a fa i nt, a ngry e c h o

from t h e eastern sky. A n d right t h e n t h e violent ra i n came t o a sudden halt,
followed by an unearthly silence. Hoshino stood up and opened the window
to let in some a i r. Th e storm clouds had vanished, the sky covered once more
by a th i n membrane of pale clouds. All the buildings were wet, the moist
cracks i n the i r walls dark, l ike old people 's vei n s . Water dripped off power
l ines and formed puddles on the ground. B i rds flew out from where they'd
sought shelter, c h i rping loudly as they vied for the bugs that were out th em­
selves now that the storm had abated.
Hosh i n o rotated h i s neck from side to side a couple of times, checking
out h i s spine. H e gave one big stretch , sat down beside the window, and gazed
outside, th e n pulled out his pack of Marlboros and lit up.
"You know, though, Mr. Nakata, after all that effort to turn that stone
over and open the entrance, nothing out of the ordinary happe n e d . N o frog
appeared, no demons, noth ing strange at a l l . Wh ich i s fi n e by m e , of
course . . . . The stage was set with all that noisy th under, but I gotta tel l you
I ' m kind of disappointed."
H e didn't get a reply, so h e turned aroun d . Nakata was leaning forward
with both hands on the floor and his eyes closed. The old man looked l ike a
feeble bug.
"What's th e matter? Are you all right?" Hosh i n o aske d .
'Tm sorry, I j ust s e e m t o be a l i ttle tired. Nakata d o e s n ' t feel so wel l . I 'd
l ike to l i e down and sleep for a wh i l e ."
Nakata's fac e did l ook awfully pal e . H i s eyes were sunken, h i s fi n ge rs
trembling. Just a few hours was all it took, it seemed, for h i m to have aged
terribly.

297

" Okay, I ' l l lay out th e futon fo r you . Feel free to sleep as much as you
want," Hoshino said. "But a re you sure you 're okay? Does you r stomach h u rt?
Do you fee l l ike you 're gonna hurl? Any ri nging i n your ears ? Or maybe you
have to take a dump. Should I get a doctor? Do you have i n s u ra n c e ? "
"Yes, t h e Govern o r gave me an insurance card , and I k e e p it safe i n
my bag."
"That's good ," Hoshino sa id, d ragging the futon out of the closet and
spreading it out. "I know th is isn't the time to go into details, but it i s n 't the
Gove rn o r of Tokyo who gave you the card . I t's a National Health c a rd , so it's
the Japanese gove rnment that issued it to you . I don't know all that much
about it, but I ' m s u re that's the case. The Governor h i mself isn't looking afte r
eve ry l i ttle detail of you r l i fe , okay? So fo rget about h i m for a wh ile."
" Nakata understands. Th e Gove rnor didn't give me the insurance c a rd .
I ' l l try t o fo rget about h i m for a wh ile. Anyway, I don't th ink I need a doctor.
If I can just get some sleep I should be all right."
"Wait a sec. You're not going to pull one of those th i rty-s ix-h o u r
m a rathons, a re you ? "
" I d o n ' t know. I d o n ' t decide how l o n g I ' m going t o s l e e p and th e n stick
to that."
"We l l , I guess that makes sense," Hosh ino admitte d . " Nobody does that.
Okay - just sleep as long as you l ike . I t's been a rough day. All that th u n d e r,
plus talking with the stone, right? And that entrance th ing opening u p . Not
someth ing you see eve ry day, that's fo r sure . You had to use you r head a lot, so
you must be tire d . Don't worry about anyth ing, just relax and catch some
shut-eye . Let old Hosh ino handle the rest."
"Much obl iged . I'm always putti ng you out, a re n ' t I? Nakata can neve r
thank you enough fo r all you 've done. I f you hadn't been with me, I wouldn't
have known what to do. And you have your own important work to do."
"Yeah, I guess so," Hoshino said i n a gloomy voi c e . So many th i n gs had
happened, h e 'd completely forgotten about h i s job . " Now that you mention
it, I really should be getting back to work soon . The boss's blowing a gasket as
we speak, I 'l l bet. I phoned h i m and said I had to take a few days off to take
c a re of someth i ng, but haven't checked i n s i n c e . Once I get back h e ' l l really
let me h ave it."
H e lit up a fresh Marlboro , leisurely exhal ing the smoke . H e stared at
a c row perched on top of a telephone pole and made silly faces at it. " B ut
who cares? He can say what he l ikes - blow steam out of h i s ears for all I
c a re . Look, I 've been pulling more than my weight fo r yea rs , working my t a i l
off.

Hey, Hoshino, we 're shorthanded, so how 'bout making a night TUn to

Hiroshima? Okay, boss, I'm on it . . . Always did what they tol d me to do,
.

n ever a complaint. Thanks to wh ich my back got shot to hell. If you didn't fix
it for me th ings would 've gone from bad to worse . I ' m only i n my mi d-twe nties,
so why should I ru i n my health over some crummy j ob, right? What's wrong
with a few days off n ow and the n ? But you know, Mr. Nakata, 1 -"
Hoshino suddenly realized the old man was sound asleep. Eyes shut
tight, face pointed toward the c e i l i ng, l ips firmly pressed togeth er, N akata was
breath ing peacefully. The fl ipped-over stone lay near his pillow.
Man, I 've n ever seen anyone fall asleep as fast as h i m , Hosh i n o thought
admiringly.
With time on his hands, h e stretched out and watched some televi s i o n ,
but h e c o u l d n ' t s t a n d any of t h e i n s i p i d afternoon programs so h e d e c i d e d to
go out. H e 'd run out of clean underwear and needed to buy s o m e . H e
detested wash i n g clothes. Bette r t o b u y s o m e cheap underpants, h e always
figured , than bother with washing the old scuzzy ones. He went to the front
desk of the i n n to pay for the next day and told th em h i s companion was
asleep and they were n ' t to wake him up. " Not that you could if you tri e d ,"
he added .
He wandered down th e streets , sniffing th e post-ra i n scent in th e air,
dressed i n h i s usual Dragons cap, green-tinted Ray-Bans, and aloha s h i rt. H e
picked up a n ewspaper at a kiosk a t th e stati on a n d checked h ow t h e Dragons
were doing - they lost to H i roshima i n an away game - th e n scanned the
movie schedule and decided to see the latest Jackie Chan fi l m . The ti ming
was perfect. H e asked directions at the pol ice box and found out i t was close
by, so h e walke d . H e bought h i s ticket, went inside, and watched the movi e ,
mun c h i n g on peanuts .
When h e g o t o u t of the movie it was already evening. H e wasn ' t a l l that
h ungry, but s i n c e h e couldn't th ink of anyth ing else to do h e decided to have
dinner. H e popped into a place nearby and ordered sushi and a beer. H e was
more tired than he realized, and only finished half the beer.
That makes sense, though , h e thought. Lifting that h eavy sto n e , of course
I'm beat. I feel l ike I 'm the oldest of th e Th ree Littl e Pigs. All the mean old
wolf's gotta d o i s huff and puff and I ' l l be blasted all the way to O kaya m a .
H e left t h e sushi bar and happened t o run across a pachi nko place.
Before h e knew it, h e was down twenty dollars. H e figured it j ust wasn't his
day, so h e gave up on pac h i nko and wandered arou nd. H e remembered h e
still hadn't bought a n y underwear.

Damn - that was the whole point of going

out, he told h i mself. H e we nt i nto a discount store i n the shopp i n g district
and bought underpants, white T-sh i rts , and socks . Now h e could finally toss

299

h is dirty underwear. He decided it was about time for a new al o h a s h irt and
scoured a few shops looking for one, only to conclude th at the p ickings in
Takam atsu were pretty slim . Summer and winter alike he always wore alo h a
s h irts ,but th at didn't m e an j u s t any aloha s h irt would d o .
H e stopped at a n e arby b akery and bought s o m e bread , i n c ase N akat a
woke up h u ngry in t h e middle of t h e night,as w e l l as a small c arton of orange
j u ic e . Next he went to a bank and used th e ATM to withdraw five h undred
dollars . C h ecking h is b al ance,he found there was stil l qu ite a lot left. These
past few ye ars h ad been so busy that h e 'd h ardly h ad time to spend any
money.
By th is time it was completely dark, and he h ad a sudden ye arning for a
cup of coffee. He l ooked around,spotting a s ign for a c afe j ust off the m ain
drag. It turned out to be the kind of old-fas h ioned coffee shop you don't find
much anymore. H e went inside, eased back onto a soft, comfortable c h air,
and ordered a c u p . C h amber music filtered out of the solid , B r itish-mad e
walnut speakers . Hoshino was the only customer. H e sank b ack in h is ch air
and ,for the fi rst time in quite a while,felt compl etely at e ase. Eve ryth ing in
the shop was c al m ing, n atural , easy to feel comfortable with . Th e coffe e ,
served i n a fan cy cup, was rich and delicious. Hoshino closed h is eyes,
breath ing in qu ietly, and listened to the inte rtwining of strings and p ian o .
H e 'd h ardly ever l istened to classical music before, but it was sooth in g and
put h im in an introspective mood.
Sunk b ack in h is soft ch air, eyes closed, lost in the music , a number of
thoughts crossed h is mind - mostly h aving to do with h imself. But the more
h e thought about h imself, the less real ity h is existe n c e seemed to h ave . He
began to feel like some meaningl ess appendage sitting there .
I 've always been a great fan of th e C h unic h i Dragons, he thought, but
what are the Dragons to me, anyway? S ay they beat the G iants - h ow's
th at going to m ake me a better person? H ow could it? S o why th e heck h ave I
spent all th is time getting worked up l ike the te am was some exte n s ion of
myself?
Mr. N akat a said h e 's empty. Maybe he is ,for all I know. B u t w h at does
th at m ake me? H e said an accident when he was l ittl e m ade h im th at way ­
empty. But I never h ad an accident. I f Mr. N akat a's e mpty, th at m akes m e
worse th an empty!A t l e ast he h as someth ing about h im - wh atever it was th at
m ade me drop everyth ing and follow h im to S h ikoku . Don't ask me w h at th at
someth ing is ,though . . . .
Hoshino ordered another cup of coffee.
"You l ike our coffee,then?" the gray-haired owner c ame over and asked .

(Hosh i n o didn't know th is, of course, but th e man used to be an official in the
Ministry of Educati o n . After retirement, he came back to his h o metown of
Takamatsu and opened up th is coffee shop, where h e made fine coffee and
played classical musi c .)
" I t's great.S u c h a nice aroma."
" I roast the beans myself. Select each bean i ndividually."
" N o wonder it's so good ."
"The music doesn't bother you ? "
"Th e mus i c ? " H o s h i n o repl ied. "No, it's great. I d o n ' t m i n d it at a l l .
Not one bit.Wh o 's playing?"
"The Rubinste i n , Heifetz , and Feuermann tri o . The M i l l i on-Dollar Tri o ,
they were d u b b e d .Consum mate artists . Th is is an old 1941 recording, but the

" I t really hasn't. Good th i ngs never grow old, do they? "
" Some people prefe r a more structured, class i c , stra i gh tforward vers i o n
of t h e Archduke Tri o . Like t h e Oistrach Trio's vers i o n ."
" N o , I th ink th is one's nice," Hoshino said. " I t has a, I don't know, gentle
feel to it."
"Thank you very much ," the owner said, thanking h i m on behalf of the
Mill ion-Dollar Tri o , and went back behind the counter.
As Hosh i n o e n j oyed his second cup he went back to his reflections.But I

get about cultur e , truth , all that j unk. That kind of inspirati o n 's what it's
all about.
Wh e n I was l i ttl e , Grandpa told me stories about Buddha's disciples.O n e
of the m w a s n a m e d Myoga .T h e g u y was a compl ete m o r o n and couldn't
memorize even the s i mplest sutra . The other disciples always teased h i m .
O n e day the B uddha said t o h i m , "Myoga , you 're n o t very bright, so you don't
have to learn any sutras. I nstead, I 'd l ike you to sit at the entrance a n d polish
everybody's shoes." Myoga was an obedient guy, so h e didn't tel l his master
to go screw h i mself. S o for ten years , twe nty years, h e diligently polished

30 J

everybody's shoes. Then one day he achieved enl ightenment and became
one of the greatest of all the Buddha's followers . That's a story Hosh i n o always
remembered, because he'd thought that had to be the crappiest kind of l i fe ,
pol ishing shoes for decades. You gotta be kidding,h e thought. B u t w h e n h e
considered it n ow, t h e story started t o take on a different underto n e . Life 's
c rappy, no matter h ow you cut it. He j ust hadn't u n derstood that when h e
was l i ttle .
These thoughts occupied h i m till the mus i c , which was helping h i m
meditate , stopped playi ng.
" H ey," he called out to th e owner. "What was that music called aga i n ?
I forget."
" B eethoven 's Archduke Trio."
" March Duke?"

"Arch. Archduke . B eethoven dedicated it to the Austrian archd uke
Rudolph . I t's not the official name,more l ike the piece's nickna m e . Rudolph
was the son of E mperor Leopold the Second. H e was a very skilled musician,
who studied piano and music theory with Beeth oven startin g when h e was
s ixte e n . H e looked up to Beethoven . Archduke Rudolph didn't make a name
for h i mself as eith e r a pianist or a composer, but sort of stood i n the shadows
lending a helping hand to Beethoven, who didn't know much about getting
ahead i n th e worl d . If it hadn't been for h i m , Beethoven would have had a
much tough er time."
"Those kind of people are necessary i n l i fe ,h u h ? "
"Absolutely."
"The world would be a real mess if everybody was a genius. Somebody's
got to keep watc h ,take care of business."
" Exactly. A world full of geniuses would have significant problems."
" I really l ike that piece."
" I t's beautifu l . You never get tired of l i stening to it. I 'd say it's th e most
refined of all B e eth oven 's piano trios. H e wrote it when h e was forty, and
n ever wrote another. H e must have decided he'd reached the p i n nacle in
the ge nre."
" I think I know what you mean. Reach ing th e pinnacle's important in
everyth ing," Hoshino said.
" Please come aga i n ."
"Yeah,I 'l l do that."
Wh e n h e got back to the room Nakata was, as expected, out c o l d . H e 'd
gone through th is before,so th is time it didn't strike h i m as odd . Just let h i m
sleep a s much a s h e wants,h e decided. The stone was still th ere,right n ext to

h i s pillow, and Hoshino put h i s sack of bread down beside it. H e took a bath
and changed i nto h i s new underwear, then balled up h is old set inside a
paper bag and tossed it in the trash . He crawled i nto h i s futon and was soon
sound asleep.
H e woke u p the n e xt morning just before n i n e . Nakata was still asleep,
h i s breath ing qu iet and regular.
Hoshino went to eat breakfast alone, asking the maid not to wake up h i s
compa n i o n . "You can just leave t h e futon l ike it is," he said.
" I s h e all right, sleeping that long?" th e maid aske d .
" Don't worry, he's not about t o die on us. H e n e e d s t o sleep to rega i n h is
strength . I know e xactly what's best for h i m ."
He bought a paper at the station and sat on a bench and l ooked through
the movie l istings. A theater near th e station was having a Fra n c,;ois Tru ffaut
retrospective . Hoshino had no idea who Truffaut was, or even if it was a man
or a woman, but a double feature was a good way of killing ti m e till evening,
so h e decided to go . The featured fil ms were

The 400 Blows and Shoot the

Pian ist. There were only a handful of customers i n the theater. H osh i n o
wasn't by any means a movie buff. Occasionally h e 'd go see o n e , a kung fu or
action film . S o these early works of Truffaut were ove r h i s head i n spots, the
pace, as you 'd e xpect of older fil ms, a bit sl uggi s h . Sti l l , h e e n j oyed th e
unique mood, th e overall look of the fil ms, h ow suggestively the characters'
inner worlds were portrayed. At the very least h e wasn't bored . I wouldn't
mind seeing some more fil ms by that guy, h e told h i mself afterward .
He e xited the theater, walked to the shopping district, and went inside
the same coffee shop as th e night before. The owne r remembered h i m .
Hosh i n o s a t i n t h e same chair a n d ordered coffe e . A s before, h e was the s al e
customer. Someth i n g with stringed instru ments was playing o n t h e stere o .
" H aydn 's first cello concerto . Pierre Fournier's playing t h e solo," the
owner e xplained as h e brought over Hoshino's coffe e .
"It's a r e a l natural sound," H o s h i n o commented.
" I t is, isn't it?" the owner said. "Pierre Fournier's one of my absol u te
favorite musicians. Like an elegant wine, h i s playing has an aroma and s ub­
stance that warms th e blood and gently encourages you . I always refe r to h i m
as Maestro Fournier o u t o f respect. I don't know h i m personally, of course ,
but I 've always felt l ike h e 's my mentor."
Listening to Fournier's fl owing, dign i fied cello, Hoshino was drawn back
to his c h i ldhood. H e used to go to the river every day to catch fish . Noth i n g to
worry about back the n , h e remi nisced . Just l ive each day as it came. As long as
I was al ive , I was

something. That was just h ow it was . But somewh e re along

the l in e it all c h anged. Living turned me into

nothing . Weird . . . People are

born in order to l ive ,right? But th e longer I 've l ived ,the more I 've lost w h at's
ins ide me - and ended up empty. And I bet the longer I l ive ,the e mptier,the
more worthless, I 'll become . Someth ing's wrong with th is p icture . L ife isn't
supposed to turn out l ike th is ! Isn't it possible to s h ift directio n , to c h ange
where I'm h e aded?
"Exc use me . . . ," Hoshino c alled out to th e owner at th e register.
" C an I help you? "
" I was wondering, if y o u h ad time,c o u l d y o u come ove r and t alk with
me? I 'd l ike to know more about th is H aydn guy."
The owner was h appy to give a mini lecture on H aydn ,the m an and h is
music . He was b as ic ally a reserved sort of person,but when it c ame to c l ass­
ical music h e was eloquent. He expl ained h ow H aydn became a h ired musi­
cian ,serving different patrons over h is long l ife ,composing who knows how
m any compositions to order. H aydn was practic al ,affable,humble,and gen­
erOllS, h e s aid ,yet also a complex person with a s ilent d arkness al l h is own
ins id e .
" H aydn was an enigmatic figure . Nobody really knows t h e amount o f
intense path os h e held inside h im . I n t h e feudal time h e was b o r n in ,though ,
he was compelled to skillfully cloak h is ego in submissiveness and displ ay
a s m art, h appy exterior. Otherwise he would h ave been c ru s h e d . A lot of
people compare h im unfavorably to B ach and Mozart - both h is music and
the way he l ived . Over h is long l ife he was inn ovative ,to be sure,but never
exactly on the cutting edge . But if you re ally p ay attention as you l isten ,you
c an c atch a h idden longing for the modern ego. Like a far-off echo ful l of
contradictions, it's all th ere in H ayd n's music , s ile ntly pulsating. Listen to
th at chord - h e ar it? I t's very quiet - right? - but it h as a persistent, inward­
moving sp irit th at's filled with a pl iant,youthful sort of curiosity."
"Like Fran c,;ois Truffaut's films."
" Exactly!" the owner excl aimed h appily, p atting Hoshino's arm reflex­
ively. "You 've h it it right on the head . You find the s ame sp irit animating
Truffaut. A persistent,inward -moving spirit th at's filled with a pl iant,youthfu l
sort of curiosity," h e repeated.
When the H aydn concerto was over Hoshin o asked h im to p l ay the
Rub instein -Heifetz-Feuerman n vers ion of th e Archduke Trio again . Wh il e l is­
te ning to th is ,h e again was lost in thought. Damn it,I don't c are wh at h ap­
pens,h e fi n ally decided. I'm going to follow Mr. N akat a as long as I l ive . To
hell with the job!

Chapter 35

W

h e n the phone rings at seven a . m . I ' m still sound asleep. I n my
dream I was deep ins ide a cave,bent over in the dark,flashlight
in hand, searc h ing for someth ing. I hear a voice far away at the

cave's e ntrance callin g out a name fa intly. I yell out a reply,but whoever it is
doesn't seem to hear m e . The person calls out my name, over and over.
Rel uctantly I stand up and start heading for the entrance . A l ittle l onger and
I would 've fou n d it,I th ink. But ins ide I ' m also rel ieved I didn't fi n d it. That's
when I wake up. I look around,collecting the scattered b its of my conscio u s­
ness. I rea l ize the phone's ringing, the phone at the l ibrary's reception desk.
B r ight sunlight's s h in ing in through the c urtains,and Miss Saeki's n o l onger
next to m e . I'm alone in bed .
I get out of bed in my T-s h irt and boxers and go out to the p h o n e . It takes
me a wh il e to get there but the phone keeps on ringing.
"Hello?"
"We re y o u asleep?" Osh ima asks .
"Yeah."
" Sorry to get you up so early on a day off,but we've got a probl e m ."
"A probl e m ? "
"I'll tell y o u a b o u t it later,b u t you 'd better not hang a r o u n d there for a
wh il e . We 're going to h ead off soon, so get your th ings together. Wh e n I get
there,j ust come out to the parking lot and get right in th e car without sayin g
anyth ing. Okay?"
" Okay," I reply.
I go back to my room and pack up. There's no need to rush s in c e it only
takes five minutes to get ready. I take down the laundry I had hangin g in the
bathroom, stuff my toilet kit, books, and diary in my backpack, the n get
dressed and stra ighten up the bed. Pull the sheets tight,plump up th e p illows,
stra ighten out the covers . C overing up all traces of what went o n here. I s it

down in the ch air and th ink about Miss S aeki,who'd been with me until a
few hours before .
I h ave time for a quick bowl o f cornflakes. Wash up th e bowl and spoon
and p ut the m away. B rush my teeth ,wash my fac e . I'm checking out my face
in the m irror when I h e ar the Miata pull into the p arking lot.
Even though the weath er's perfect,Osh im a h as the t an top u p . I shoul­
der my p ack, walk over to the c ar, and climb into the p assenger seat. As
before,Osh im a does a good job of tying my pack down on top of the trunk.
H e 's wearing a p air of Arm ani-type sunglasses,and a striped l inen s h irt ove r a
white V-neck T-sh irt,wh ite j e ans,and n avy blue,l ow-c ut C onverse Al l -Stars.
C as u al d ay-off cloth e s .
He h ands me a n avy b l u e cap with a North Face logo on it. " D idn't you
say yo u lost your h at somewhere? Use th is one. It'll help h ide your face a l ittl e ."
"Th anks ," I s ay,and tug on the c ap .
Oshim a checks me o u t in the c ap and nods h is approval . "You h ave sungl asses,right?"
I nod,take my sky blue Revos from my pocket,and p ut th em o n .
''Ve ry cool ," h e says . 'Try putting the c ap on b ackward ."
I do as h e s ays ,turning the c ap around.
Osh im a nods again . "Great. You look l ike a rap s inger fro m a I1lce
family." He s h ifts to fi rst,slowly steps on the gas,and lets out the clutc h .
"Wh e re are w e going?" I ask.
"The same p l ace as before ."
"The mountains in Koc h i?"
Osh im a nods. " Right. Anoth er long drive ." H e fl ips on the stereo. I t's
a cheerful Mozart orchestral piece I 've heard before. The " Posthorn Sere­
n ade," m aybe ?
"Are y o u tired of th e mountains?"
" N o ,I l ike it there. It's quiet,and I c an get a lot of reading done."
"Good," Osh im a s ays .
" So wh at was the problem you mentioned?"
Oshim a shoots a sullen look at the rearview mirror,gl ances over at me,
the n faces forward again . " F irst of all ,the pol ice got b ack in touch with m e .
Phoned my place l ast night. Sounds l ike they're getting serious about tracking
you down . They seemed pretty intense about th e whole th ing."
" B ut I h ave an alibi,don't I?"
"Yes,you d o . A solid alibi. The day the murder took place you were in
S h ikoku. Th ey don't doubt that. What they're th inking is you m ight've
spired with somebody else."

CO\1-

"C onspired ? "
"You might have h a d an accompl ice."
Accompl i c e ? I shake my head . "Where 'd they get that idea?"
"They're pretty tight-l ipped about it. They're pushy about asking ques­
tions,but get all l ow key when you try turning the tables o n th e m . S o I spent
th e whole night o n l i n e , downloading informati on about the case . D i d you
know there're a couple of websites up already about it? Yo u're pretty fam o us .
The wandering prince w h o holds the key t o the puzzle."
I give a small sh rug.

The wandering prince?

"With o n l i n e informati on it's hard to separate fact from wishfu l th inking,
but you could s u m marize it l ike th is: The pol ice are now after a guy i n his
late sixtie s . The night of th e murder he showed up at a police box near the
Nogata shopp i n g distri ct and confessed to j ust having murdered somebody i n
t h e neighborh o o d . S a i d h e stabbed h i m . But h e spouted out all kinds of n o n ­
s e n s e ,so t h e young cop on th e b e a t tagged h i m as crazy and sent h i m o n h i s
way without getti ng t h e whole story. Of course w h e n th e mur d e r came to
l ight,the policeman knew he'd bl own it. He hadn't taken down th e old m a n 's
name or address,and if h i s superi ors heard about it th ere 'd be hell to pay,so
h e kept quiet about it. But something happened - I have n o idea what - and
the whole th i n g came to light. The cop was discipl ined,of cour s e . Poor guy'll
probably never l ive it down ."
Osh ima downsh ifts to pass a white Toyota Terce l ,the n nimbly slips back
i nto the lane. "The pol ice went all out and were able to identify th e old m a n .
They don't know h i s background, b u t he appears t o be mentally impaired.
Not retarded, j ust a teeny bit off. H e l ives by h i mself on welfare and some
support from relatives . But h e 's disappeared from h i s apartment. The police
traced h i s move m ents and th ink he was h itchh iking,heading for S h ikoku. An
i ntercity bus driver th inks he might've ridden h is bus out of Kob e . H e remem­
bered h i m because he had an unusual way of talking and said some weird
th ings. Apparently he was with some young guy in h i s mid-twenties. The two
of the m got o ut at Tokushima Stati o n . They've located the i n n where they
stayed,and according to a housekeeper,they took a tra i n to Takamats u . The
old man's movements and yours overlap exactly. B oth of you l e ft N ogata in
Naka no Ward and headed stra ight for Takamats u . A l i ttle too much of a c o i n ­
cidence,so naturally the pol ice a r e reading someth ing i nto i t - th i nking that
th e two of you planned the whole th ing togeth er. The National Pol i c e
Agency's even getti ng i n th e act,and n ow they're scouring t h e city. We might
not be able to hide you at th e l ibrary anymore,so I decided you 'd better l i e
low i n t h e mounta i n s . "

"A mentally impaired old m an from Nakano?"
"Ring any bells?"
I s h ake my h e ad . "None."
" H is address isn't far from your house. A fifteen-minute walk,apparently."
" B u t tons of people l ive in N akano. I don't even know who l ives n ext
door."
"There 's more," Osh im a says , and glances at me. " H e 's the one who
m ade all those m ackerel and sardines rain down from the sky in the N agat a
shopping district. A t l e ast h e predicted t o th e pol ice th at l ots of fi s h would fall
from th e sky the d ay before it h appened."
"Th at's amaz ing," I say.
" Isn't it?" Oshim a says . "And the same d ay, in the eve n ing, a h uge
amount of leeches rained down on the Fuj igawa rest stop on th e Tomei H igh­
way. Remember?"
"Ye ah ,I do."
"None of th is s l ipped past the pol ice,of cour s e . They're guessing there's
got to be some connection between th ese events and th is mystery m an they're
after. H is movements p arallel everyth ing so cl osely."
The Mozart p iece ends,and another begins.
H ands on the steering wh eel,Osh im a shakes h is h e ad a couple of tim e s .
"A really strange turn of events. It started out weird and is gettin g even
weirder as it goes along. Impossible to predict what'll h appen n ext. One
th ing's for sure, though . Everyth ing seems to be converging right here. The
old m an 's path and yours are bound to cross ."
I close my eyes and l isten to the roar of th e engin e . " M aybe I should go to
some other town ," I tell h im . "Apart from anyth ing else,I don't want to c ause
you or M iss S aeki any more trouble."
"But where would you go?"
" I don't know. But I c an figure it out if you t ake me to the statio n . I t
doesn't really m atter."
Osh im a sighs . "I don't th ink that's such a s m art ide a. The statio n h as to
be crawling with cops, all on th e lookout for a cool,t al l ,fifteen-ye ar-old boy
lugging a b ackpack and a bunch of obsessions."
"So why not take me to a station far away th at they're not staking out?"
" I t's al l the same. I n the e n d they'll find you ."
I don't s ay anyth ing.
"Look, they h aven't issued a warrant for your arrest. You 're not o n th e
most-wa nted l ist or anyth ing, okay?"
I nod.

"Wh ich means you 're still free. So I don't need anybody's permission to
take you anywhere I want. I ' m not brea king the law. I mean, I don't even
know you r real fi rst name, Kafka . So don't worry about me. I'm a very c a u ­
t i o u s person . Nobody's going t o nab me so easily."
"Oshima?" I say.
"Yes?"
" I didn't plan anyth ing with anybody. If I had to kill my fath er, I wouldn't
ask anybody to do it."
" I know."
H e stops at a red l ight and checks the rearview mirror, then pops a lemon
drop i nto h i s mouth and offers me o n e .
I slip it i n my mouth . "What c o m e s after that? "
"What do you mean? " Osh ima asks .
"You said

first of a ll. About why I have to go h ide in the h i l l s . If th ere's a

fi rst reason, there's got to be a second."
Oshima stares at the red l i ght, but it doesn 't change . " C ompared to the
fi rst, the second isn't very important."
" I still want to hear it."
" I t's about M i ss Saeki ," he says . The light finally tu rns green and h e steps
on the gas . "Yo u 're sleeping with her, right?"
I don't know how to answer that.
"Don't worry, I'm not blaming you or anyth ing. I j ust have a sense for
these th ings, that's all . She's a wonderful person, a very attractive lady.
She's - special, in all sorts of ways . She's a lot older than you , sure, but so
what? I understand your attraction to her. You want to have sex with her, so
why not? She wants to have sex with you ? More power to h e r. I t doesn't
bother me. If you guys are okay with that, it's fine by m e . " Osh i m a rolls th e
lemon drop around in h is mouth . " B u t I th i n k it's best if you two keep your
distance for a wh i l e . And I don't mean because of that bloody mess i n Nakano."
"Why, th e n ? "
" S h e 's i n a very d e l i cate place right now."
" H ow so?"
" M i ss Saeki . . . ," h e begi ns, searching for th e rest. "What I mean is, she's
dyi ng. I 've felt it for a long time."
I ra ise my s unglasses and look at h i m cl osely. H e 's looki n g stra ight ahead
as h e drives. We 've tu rned onto the h i ghway to Koc h i . Th is time, surprisingly,
he keeps to the speed l i mit. A Toyota Supra whooshes past u s .
"Wh e n y o u s a y she's dying . . . , " I begi n . "You m e a n s h e 's g o t an i n c ur­
able disease? Cancer or le ukemia or someth ing?"

Oshima shakes h i s head . "That could be. But I don't know anyth ing
about her health . For all I know she might be saddled with a disease l ike that.
I th ink it's more of a psychological issue. The will to l ive - someth ing to do
with that."
"You're sayi ng she's lost the will to l ive ?"
" I th ink so. Lost the will to go on l iving."
" Do you th ink she's going to kill herself?"
" N o , I don 't," Oshima repl ies. "It's j ust that very qu ietly, very steadily,
she's heading towa rd death . Or else death is heading toward her."
"Like a tra i n heading toward the station?"
" Someth ing l ike that," Oshima said, and stopped, h i s l i ps taut. " B u t th e n

you showed up, Kafka . C o o l as a cu cumber, mysterious as the r e a l Kafka .
The two of you were drawn togeth er and, to use the class i c expression, you
have a relationship."
"And the n ? "
For a b r i e f m o m e n t O s h i m a lifts both h a n d s off t h e wh eel . "That's it."
I slowly shake my head. " I bet you 're th inking I 'm

the train."

Osh ima doesn't say anyth ing for a long ti m e . " Exactly," he finally says .
"That's it, exactly."
"That I'm bringing about her death ?"
" I' m not blaming you for th is, mind you," h e says . " I t's a ctually for
the best."
"Why?"
H e doesn't answer th i s . You're

supposed to find the answer to that, h i s
It's too obvious to even think about.

s i l e n ce tells m e . Or maybe he's saying,

I lean back in my seat, shut my eyes, and let my body go l i m p . " Os h i m a ? "
"What is i t ? "
" I don't know w h a t t o do anymore . I d o n ' t even know w h a t dire ction I ' m
fa ci ng i n . What's right, what's wrong - whether I s h o u l d k e e p on going ahead
or turn arou nd. I'm totally lost."
Osh ima keeps silent, no answer forth coming.
" You 've got to help me. What am I supposed to do?" I ask h i m .
"You don't have t o do anyth i ng," he says si mply.
" Noth ing?"
H e nods. "Wh i ch is why I'm taking you to the mountains."
" B u t what should I do once I get there?"
"Just l isten to the wind," he says . "That's what I always do."
I mull th is over.

We all die and disappear, but that's because the m e chanism of th e world itself

I squeeze h i s hand back. It's soft and warm . H i s smooth, s e xless, d e l i ­

W

hen he got back to the i n n , Hosh ino found Nakata - no sur­
prise - still fast asleep.The sack h e 'd put n ext to him with bread
and orange j u i ce was unto u ched.The old man hadn't s h i fted an

i n ch , probably hadn't woken up once the whole time. Hoshino cou nted up
the h ours. Nakata had gone to sleep at two the previous a fternoon, wh i ch
meant he'd been asleep for th i rty solid hours. What day is it, anyway?
Hoshino wondered. H e was completely losing tra ck of time. He took h i s
memo book o u t of h i s b a g a n d checked.Let's s e e , h e told h i mself, we arrived
i n Tokush ima on a Saturday on the bus from Kobe, then Nakata slept till
M o n day. On Monday we left Tokushima for Takamatsu, Thursday was all
that ruckus with the stone and th under, and that a fternoon h e went to sleep.
S o skip ahead one night and that would make today ... Friday.It's l ike the
old guy came to S h ikoku to attend some Sleep Festival or someth i ng.
Like the night before, Hoshino took a bath , watched lV for a while, th e n
cl imbed into h i s futon . Nakata was still breath ing peacefully, sound asleep.
Whatever, Hosh ino thought.Just go with th e flow. Let h i m sleep as much
as he wants. No need to worry about that. And he h i mself fell asleep, at
ten-th irty.
At five the n ext morning the cell phone in h i s bag went off, j olting h i m
awake.Nakata was still o u t l ike a l ight.
Hosh ino rea ched for the phone."Hello."
" M r.Hosh i n o !" A man's voi ce.
"Colonel Sanders?" Hoshino said, recognizing the voi ce .
"The very o n e .How's it hanging, sport?"
" F i n e , I guess ....But how'd you get th is number? I didn't give it to you ,
a n d the phone's been turned off a l l th is time s o those clowns from work won't
bother m e .So how could you call me? You 're kind of freaki ng me out h e r e ."
" I t's l ike I told you , I'm neither a god nor a Buddha, not
I ' m someth ing else again - a

h u m a n being.

concept. So making your phone ring is a ci n ch .

Piece of cake.Whether it's turned on or not makes not one j ot of differe n ce ,
my friend.Don 't let every little th ing g e t t o you ,okay? I could 've run over a n d
b e e n right there b e s i d e y o u w h e n y o u woke up,but I figured that'd be a bit o f
a shock."
"You bet it would."
"Wh i ch explains the phone cal l .I ' m a well-mannered person ,a fter a l l ."
"I appre ciate it," Hoshino said. " S o anyway, what're we supposed to do
with the stone? Nakata and I managed to flip it over so that entra n ce th ing
opened up.Lightning was flashing l ike crazy outs i d e ,and the sto n e weighed
a ton .Oh,that's right - I haven't told you about Nakata yet.H e 's the guy I ' m
traveling with ."
"I know all about Mr. Nakata," Colonel Sanders said. " N o need to
expl a i n ."
"You know about h i m ? " Hosh ino said. "Okay.... Anyhow, Nakata
went into h ibernation a fter that,and the stone's stil l here.Don't you th ink we
should get it b a ck to th e shrine? We might be cursed for taking it without
permIss Io n ."
"You never give up, do you ? H ow many times did I tell you there's n o
curse?" Colonel Sanders said disgustedly." Keep t h e stone there for t h e t i m e
being.You o p e n e d it up, and eventually you'll have t o close it aga i n .T h e n
y o u can take it b a ck.But it's not t i m e for that yet.Get i t ? We okay h e re ? "
"Yeah, I get it," Hoshino said. "Th ings that are open have to be sh ut.
Th i ngs you have ,you gotta return th e way they were .All

right al ready! Any­

how,I 've decided not to th ink about th i ngs so much .I 'll go along with what­
ever you want, no matter how crazy it sounds. I had a kind of revelation last
night.Taking crazy th ings seriously is - a serious waste of ti me."
"A very wise con clusion.There's that sayi ng,' Pointless th inking is worse
than no th inking at a l l .' ''
"I l ike that."
" Ve ry suggestive , don't you th i nk?"
" H ave you heard the saying ' S heepish butlers' surgical bottl e battl e s ' ? "
"What on earth is t h a t supposed t o mean? "
" It's a tongue-twi ster.I made it up."
"Your point being?"
"No point,really.I j ust felt l ike saying it."
"C an the stupid comments, all right? I don't have much pati e n ce with
inanity.You'll drive me nuts if you keep it up."
" S orry," Hoshino said. " B u t why'd you call me,anyway? You must have
had a reason to call so early."

"That's right. It completely slipped my mind," C o l o n el S a n d ers said.
" H ere's th e th ing - I want you to l eave that inn right th is minute. N o t i m e
t o eat breakfast.J u s t wake up M r . Nakata , grab th e sto n e, and get o u t . G et
a cab,but don't have th e inn call one for you . Go out to th e m a i n street and
flag o n e down .Th en give th e driver th is address. Do you have someth ing to
write with ?"
"Yep ,j ust a s ec ," Hoshino repl i ed,grabb ing a pen and h i s n otebook from
h i s bag." B room and dustpan,check."
"E nough with th e stupid j okes al ready!" Colonel Sanders yel l ed i n to th e
phone.' ' I ' m seri ous h ere.Not a mi nute to lose."
" Okay,okay.Go a h ead."
Colonel Sanders recited th e address and Hosh i n o wrote it down ,rep eat­
ing it to make sure he got it right: "Apartm ent 308,Takamatsu Park H eights
16-15,3-ch o m e.Is that it?"
"That's fi n e," Colonel Sanders repl i ed."You'll fi n d th e key u n d er a black
umbrella stand at th e front door.Unlock th e door and go i n s i d e.You can stay
th ere as long as you like.Th ere's a stock of food and th i ngs,so you won't have
to go out for th e ti m e b ei ng."
"That's your place? "
" I t is indeed . I don't own it, th ough . It's rented . So make yoursel f at
h o m e.I got th e place for you two."
"Colonel ? "
"Yeah?"
"You told m e you're not a god,or a Buddha,or a human b ei ng,correct?"
"Correct."
" So I ' m assuming you 're not of th is worl d ."
"You got it."
"Th en how could you rent an apartm ent? You 're not h u m a n , so you
don't have all th e papers and stuff you n eed ,right? A family register,local reg­
istration, proof of income, official stamp and s eal and all that. If you don't
have those, nobody's gonna rent you a plac e. Di d you c h eat or s o m eth ing?
Like change a l eaf by magic into an official stamp? Enough u n d erh a n d ed
stuff's gone on already,I don't want to get mixed up in any more."
"You j ust don't get it,do you ?" Colonel Sanders said,clicking h i s tongu e.
"You are one major dimwit.Is yo ur brain made out of j ello,you spinel ess twit?
A le a f? What do you th ink I am,one of those magical raccoons? I'm a

concept,
Con-cept! Concepts and raccoons aren't exactly th e same, n ow are

th ey? What a dumb th i ng to say....Do you really th ink I went ovcr to th e real
estate agent's, fill ed out all th e fo rms,bargained with th em to l ower th e rent?

Ridiculous! I have a secretary take care of temporal th ings. My secretary gets
all the necessary documents and th i ngs togeth er. Wh at do you expect?"
"Ah - so you have a

secretary! "

" Damn right I do! Wh o do you th ink I am, anyway? You 're way out of
l i n e . I ' m a busy m a n , so why shouldn't I have a secretary?"
"All right, all right - don't blow a gasket. I was j ust pulling your leg. Any­
way, why do we have to leave so fast? Can't we at least have a bite before we
go? I'm starved , and Mr. Nakata's out l ike a l ight. I couldn't wake h i m up n o
matter h ow hard I try."
" Listen u p . Th is is no j oke. The pol i ce are s couring the town for you .
First th i n g th is morning, they've been making th e rounds o f hotels a n d i n n s ,
questi oning everyo n e . They've already got a description of both of you . S o
once they start n o s i n g around it's o n l y a matte r o f ti m e . T h e two of y o u stand
out, let's fa ce it. There's not a moment to lose."
"The cops?" Hoshino shouted . "Gimme a break! We haven't clon e any­
th ing wrong. Sure, I ripped off a few motorcycles back in h igh s chool . Just
j oyriding - it wasn't l ike I was gonna sell them or anyth i ng. I always took
th em back . N ever done anyth ing ill egal s i n ce . Taking that sto n e from the
shrine i s about the worst th ing I 've clone. And you

told me to ."

"Th is has noth i n g to do with the stone," Colonel Sanders said flatly.
"You 're a real d u n ce someti mes. Forget th e sto n e . The pol i ce don't know any­
th ing about it, and wouldn't give a damn if they did. They're not going to be
up at the crack of dawn beating down doors ove r some sto n e . We 're talking
about someth ing much more serious."
"What cia you mean? "
"The pol i ce are after Mr. Nakata because of it."
" I don 't get it. H e 's th e last person you 'd ever imagine com m i tting a
cri me . What kind of crime? And how could he be i nvolve d ? "
"No time t o go i nto that now. You have t o g e t h i m out of there . Eve ry­
th ing depends on you . Are we cl ear here? "
" I don't get it," Hoshino repeated, shaking h i s head. " I t j ust doesn't make
any sense. S o they're gonna tag me as an a ccompl i ce ? "
"No, but I ' m sure they'll qu estion you . Ti me's a-wasti ng. Don ' t bother
your head over it n ow, j ust do as I say. "
"Liste n , you gotta understand one th ing about m e . I

hate cops. They're

worse than the yakuza - worse than the S DF. They're awfu l , the th i ngs they
do. They strut around and love noth i ng better than tormenting the weak.
I had plenty of ru n -ins with cops when I was in h igh s chool, even a fte r I
started driving tru cks, so the last th ing I need is to get i nto a fight with the m .

There's no way you can win, plus you can't shake ' em off afterward . You know
what I mean? God, how'd I get mixed up in all th is? You see, what 1 -"
The phone went dead.

"Jeez," H osh i n o said. H e sighed deeply and tossed th e cell phone i nto h i s
bag, then tri ed t o wake Nakata u p .
" H ey, M r . Nakata. Gramps. Fire! Flood! Earthquake! Revoluti o n ! God­
z i l la's on the loose! Get

up, al ready! "

It was some time before Nakata woke up. "I finished the beve l i ng," h e
said. ''The rest I u s e d as kindling. No, cats d o n ' t take bath s . I ' m th e one w h o
took t h e bath ." Obvi ously i n his own little world.
Hosh ino shook the old man's shoulder, p i n ched h i s nose, tugged at h i s
ears, and fi nally roused h i m t o t h e l a n d o f t h e l iving.
"Is that you , Mr. Hosh ino?" he asked.
"Yeah, it's m e ," Hoshino repl ied. " Sorry to wake you up."
"No problem. Nakata was going to get up soon anyway. Don 't worry
about it. I fi nished with the kindl ing."
"Good. But someth i n g's come up - someth ing not so good - and we
have to get out of here right now."
" I s it about Johnnie Walker?"
"That I don't know. I 've got my sources, and they told me we better make
ourselves scarce . Th e cops are after us."
"Is that right?"
"That's what h e said. But what happened with you and th is Johnnie
Walker guy? "
" Didn't Nakata already tell you?"
"No, you didn't."
" I feel l ike I did, though ."
"No, you never told me the most important part."
"Well, what happened was - Nakata killed h i m ."
"You gotta be kidding! "
" N o , I 'n1 not."
" Jeez Louise," Hosh i n o muttered .
Hosh ino th rew h i s belongi ngs into h i s b a g and wrapped th e stone back
up in its cloth . It was the same weight as it had been original ly. Not l i ght, but
at least h e could carry it. Nakata put his th ings i n h i s canvas bag. H o s h i n o
w e n t t o th e front desk and told th em someth ing had come up suddenly a n d
they had t o che ck o u t . S i n ce he'd p a i d in advance , it d i d n ' t take l o n g . Nakata
was still a bit u nsteady on his feet but could walk. " H ow long did I sleep?"
he asked.

" Let me see," Hoshino said, doing the math. "About forty hours , give
or take."
"I feel l ike I slept well."
"No wonder.If you don't feel refres hed after that kind of record-breaking
sleep, the n sleep's kind of pointless, isn't it.H ey, you hu ngry?"
"Yes, I a m .Very hu ngry."
" C a n you hold off a while? First we have to get out of here, as soon as we
can .The n we 'll eat."
"That's all right.I can wait."
Hoshino helped him out onto the main street and flagged down a cab .
H e told the driver the address , a n d the driver nodded and s p e d off. The
cab left the city, d rove down a main thoroughfare, and entered a suburb.The
neighborhood was upscale and quiet, qu ite a contrast from the noisy area
near the statio n w here they'd been staying.The ride took about twenty-five
minutes.
They stopped i n front of a typ i cal five-story neat-as-a-p i n apartm ent b u i l d­
i ng.Takamatsu Park Heights, the sign said, though it was on a l evel expanse
with n o park i n sight. They rode the elevator up to the thi rd floor, where
Hos hino found the key, sure enough, under the umbrella sta n d .The apart­
ment was a standard two-bedroom place , with a dinette kitche n , a l iving
room, and a bathroom.The place was brand new, by the l ooks of it, the fu rni­
ture barely lIsed.The l iving room contained a widescreen TV, a small stere o ,
a sofa and a l ove seat, and each bedroom had a bed already made up.The
kitche n had the usual utensils, t he s helves stocked with a passable set of
plates, cups, and bowls .There were smart-l ooking framed prints o n the wal l s ,
and the whole place l ooked l ike s o m e model apartment a developer might
come up with to s how new cl ients.
"Not bad at all," Hos hino remarked. " Not mu ch characte r, but at least
it's clean."
" I t's very pretty," Nakata added.
The large, off-white fridge was packed with food. M uttering to himself,
Nakata che cked out everything, fi nally taking out some eggs, a gre e n pepper,
and butter.H e rinsed off the pepper, sl i ced it i nto thi n strips , and sauteed it.
Next h e broke the eggs i nto a bowl and \vhipped them up with chopsti cks.He
pulled out a frying pan and proceeded to make two green-pepper omelettes
with a practiced tou ch.He topped this off with toast and took the whole meal
over to the dining tabl e , along with hot tea.
"You 're quite the cook," Hos hino said.'Tm impressed."
'Tve always l ived alone, so I ' m used to it."

" I l ive alone too , but don't ask me to cook anyth ing, ' cause 1 stink at it."
"Nakata has a lot of free time and noth ing else to do."
The two of th em ate their toast and omel ettes. They were still h u ngry, so
Nakata went back to the kitchen and sauteed some bacon and spinach ,
wh i ch they h a d with two more slices o f toast each . Starti ng t o feel human
aga i n , they sank back on th e sofa and had a second cup of tea .
" S o ," Hosh ino said, "you killed somebody, h u h ? "
"Yes, I did," Nakata answered, a n d gave a detailed a ccount of h ow h e
stabbed J o h n n i e Walker t o death .
"Man al ive," Hosh i no said when he'd finished . "What a freaky story. The
pol i ce would never believe that, no matter h ow honest you are about it. 1
mean,

I believe you , but if you 'd told me that a week ago 1 would h ave sent

you packing."
" I don't understand it myself."
"At any rate , somebody's been murdered, and murder's not someth i n g
y o u j ust sh rug off. T h e pol i ce aren't fooling around on th is one, not if they've
trailed you out here to Sh ikoku ."
"Nakata's sorry you had to get involved."
"Are n't you gonna give yourself up?"
" N 0 , I'm n ot," Nakata said with u n characteristic firmness. "I al ready
tri ed to, but right now 1 don't feel l ike doing that. There a re some oth e r th i ngs
Nakata has to do. Otherwise it's pointless for me to have come all th is way."
"You have to close that entrance again."
"That's right. Things that are open have to be shut. Then I will be normal
aga i n .But there are some th i ngs Nakata has to take care of fi rst."
"Colonel Sanders , th e guy who told me where the stone is," Hoshino
said, " i s helping us l i e low. But why's he doing th is? I s th e re some con n e ction
between h i m and Johnnie Walker?"
The more Hoshino tried to unravel it, though , the more confused h e got.
Better not to try to make sense, he decided, of what bas i cally doesn't make
any. " Pointless th inking is worse than no th inking at a l l ," h e con cluded out
loud, his arms crossed .
"Mr. Hosh i n o ? " Nakata said.
"What's up?"
" I smell the sea."
Hosh i n o went to the window, opened it, went out on the narrow veranda,
and breathed i n deeply. No sea smells that he could dete ct. Off i n the dis­
tance , wh ite summer clouds floated above a pine forest. " I don't smell any­
th i ng," he said.

Nakata ca me over beside h i m and started sniffing, h i s nose twitch i n g l ike
a squ i rre l ."I can .The sea 's right over there." H e pointed to the forest.
"You have quite a nose there," Hoshino said. " I have a tou ch of a sinus
probl em myself, so I'm always a bit stuffed up."
" Mr.H o s h i n o , why don't we walk over to the o cea n ? "
Hosh i n o thought about i t .How could a little walk on t h e beach h u rt a nyth i ng? " Okay, l et's go."
" Nakata has to take a dump first, if it's all right."
"Take you r ti m e , we 're in no rush."
Wh i l e N akata was in th e toilet Hoshino walked aro u n d the apartment,
che cking it out.Like the C olonel said, th ere was pretty mu ch everyth ing they
needed. Shaving cream in th e bath room, a couple of new toothbrushes, Q­
tips, Band-Aids, nail cl ippers.All the bas i cs .Even an iron and ironing board.
Very considerate of h i m , Hosh ino thought, though I imagine his s e cretary did
all th e work.They haven't forgotten a th ing.
H e opened the closet and found fresh underwear and clothes.No aloha
s h i rts, unfortu nately, j ust some ordinary striped s h i rts and polo s h i rts , brand­
new Tommy H i l fi gers."And here I was th inking Colonel Sanders was pretty
qu i ck on the u ptake ," Hosh ino complained to no one in parti cular. " H e
should've figured o u t I only wear aloha shirts . I f he went t o a l l th i s trouble,
h e at least could 've bought me one." H e noti ced the s h i rt h e had o n was get­
ting a bit rank, so took it off and pulled on a polo s h i rt.It was a pe rfect fit.
They walked through the pines, up over a breakwater, and down to the
beach .The Inland Sea was cal m .They sat down side by side on the sand, not
speaking for a long time, watch i n g the waves rise up l ike sheets being fl u ffed
i nto the a i r a n d the n , with a fa int sound, break apart. S everal small islands
were visible offshore.Neither of them had been to the sea very o fte n i n th eir
l ives, and they feasted th eir eyes on the scene.
" M r.Hoshino?" Nakata said, breaking the s i l e n ce .
"What is it?"
"The sea i s a really n i ce th i ng, isn't it?"
"Yeah, it i s .Makes you feel cal m ."
"Why is that? "
"Probably ' cause it's so big, with noth ing on it," Hoshino said, pointing.
"You wouldn't feel so calm if there was a 7-Eleven over th ere, or a Seiyu depart­
ment store, would you? Or a pach i nko place over th ere, or a Yosh ikawa pawn ­
shop? But as far as the eye can see there 's

nothing

-

wh i ch is pretty darn n i ce."

" I snppose you 're right," Nakata sa id, giving it some thought. " M r.
Hosh i n o ? "

"What's up? "
" I have a question about something else. "
" Sh oot. "
"What's at the bottom of th e sea? "
"The re 's l ike anoth e r world down there , all kinds of fish, shellfish,
seaweed, and stuff. You 've never been to an aquari u m ? "
" N o , I 've never been. The place where Nakata l ived for a long time,
Matsu moto , didn 't have one of those . "
"No, I don't i magine it would," Hoshino said. "A town l ike that off in th e
h i l l s - I guess a mushroom museum or someth ing would be about all you
could expect. Anyhow, th ere 's all kinds of stuff at th e bottom of the sea. The
animals are different than us - they take oxygen from the wate r and don't
need a i r to b reath e . There 're some beautiful th i ngs down th ere, some deli­
cious things, plus some dangerous th ings. And th ings that'd totally creep you
out. I f you 've never seen it, it's hard to expla i n , but it's completely diffe rent
than what we're used to . Way down at the bottom it's totally dark and the re
a re some of the grossest creatures you 've ever seen. What do you say when all
th is blows ove r we ch eck out an aquari um? They're kind of fu n , and I have n ' t
been t o one in a long time. I'm s u r e there 's one a round here. "
"Yes, I 'd love to go to a place like that. "
"Th e re 's someth ing I wanted to ask

you. "

"Yes? "
"The oth e r day we lifted up that stone and opened th e entra n ce , right? "
"Yes, you and I opened up the entran ce . Afte r that Nakata fel l sound
asleep. "
"What I want to know is - did someth ing take place because the
entra n ce opened up? "
Nakata gave a nod. "Yes. It did. "
" B u t you still don't know what that is. "
Nakata gave a decis ive shake of his head. "No, Nakata doesn't know yet. "
" S o maybe it's happening someplace else, right th is mi nute ? "
" Yes, I th ink that's tru e . As you said, it's happe ning. And I ' m wa iting fo r it
to finish happening. "
"And o n ce whateve r it is finishes taking place , eve ryth ing will work
itself out? "
Anoth e r definitive shake of the head. "That Nakata doesn't know. I ' m
doing what I ' m doing because I

must. B u t I have no i d e a what w i l l happen

b e cause of what I do. I'm not so bright, so it's too hard for me to figure out.
I don't know what's goi ng to happen . "

po

"At any rate , it's gonna take some ti me, right? For whatever th is is to
finish up and some con clusion or something to happe n ? "
"That is correct."
"And wh i l e we 're wa iting we have to make sure the cops don't grab u s .
' C a u s e there's s t i l l stuff that n e e d s doing?"
" C o rrect. I don't mind visiting the pol i ce . I ' m ready to do whatever the
Governor tel l s me to do.But now is j ust not a good time to do that."
"You know what? If th e cops h eard your crazy story, they'd j ust blow it off
and make up some convenient confession, someth i n g anyo n e would b e l i eve.
Like you were robb ing the house and you heard somebody, so you grabbed a
knife from the kitchen and stabbed h i m .They don't give a damn what the
real fa cts are , or what's right. Fra ming somebody j ust to j a ck up th eir arrest
rate .They wouldn't bat an eye.Next th ing you know, you 're thrown i n j a i l or
some maximu m-s e curity psycho ward . They'd lock you up and th row away
th e key.You don't have enough money to h i re some fan cy lawyer, so they'd
sti ck you with some cou rt-appointed bozo who couldn't care less, so it's obvi­
ous h ow it'd end up."
'Tm afra id I don't understand all - "
" I'm j ust tel l i n g you what cops are l ike. Believe me, I know," H o s h i n o
s a i d ." S o I really don't want t o take ' em on, okay? C ops and me j ust don't h i t
it off."
'Tm sorry to cause so many problems for you ."
Hoshino s ighed deeply. "As they say, though , 'Take the poison, take
the plate .' "
"What does that mean?"
"If you 're gonna take poison , you might as well eat the plate it ca me o n ."
" B u t if you eat a plate , you 'll di e .It's not good for your teeth , either.And
it'll hurt you r throat."
'Td have to agree ," Hosh ino said, puzzl ing over it. "Yeah - why

do you

have to eat the plate ? "
'Tm not so bright, so I really ca n't tell you .But a s i d e from th e poiso n , the
plate 's way too hard."
" U m . You got that right. I ' m starti ng to get confused myself. I n ever was
one for using my head, either.What I'm trying to say is, I 've come th is far so
I'll sti ck with you and make sure you escape.I can't believe you did anyth ing
bad, and I'm not going to j ust abandon you here.I 've got my honor to consider."
" M u ch obliged. Nakata can't thank you enough . I 'll presume on you
aga i n , though, and ask one more favor."
"Go for it."

321

"We'll need a car."
"Would a rental car be okay? "
" Nakata doesn't really know what that is, but any kind is fi n e . B i g or small
is all right as long as it's a car."
"No probl e m . Now you 're talking my specialty. I ' l l go p i ck one up i n a
w h i l e . So we're gonna be heading out somewhere ?"
" I th ink so. We probably will be headed out somewhere."
"You know someth ing, Mr. Nakata ?"
"Yes?"
" I never get bored when I ' m with you . All kinds of off-the-wall th i n gs
happe n , but that much 1 can say for sure - being with you 's n ever boring."
'Thank you for saying that. 1 feel rel i eved to hear it. But Mr. H osh i n o ? "
"What's up?"
'Tm not really sure 1 understand what being bored means."
"You 've never been bored before?"
"No, not even o n ce ."
"You know, 1 kind of had the feeling that might be the case."

W

e stop a t a town to have a bite to eat and stock u p o n food and
m i n e ral water at a supermarket, then drive up the u n paved road
through the hills and arrive at the cab i n . Inside, it's exa ctly as I

left it a week ago. I open the window to a i r out the place , th e n stow away
the foo d .
'Tm goi n g t o take a n a p before I h e a d back," Oshima says, nearly cover­
i ng h i s fa ce with h i s hands as he lets out a h uge yawn. " I didn't sleep well
last night."
He must really be exhausted , because as soon as he gets under the covers
and tu rns toward th e wal l , he's out.I make some coffee and pour it i n a th er­
mos for h i s ride back, then head down to the brook with the aluminum pail to
fill up on water.The forest hasn't changed a bit - th e same smell of grasses,
birdcalls, babb l i n g water in the brook, the rush of wind th rough the trees, the
same shadows of rustl ing leaves.The clouds above me look really cl ose.I feel
nostalgic to see th em aga i n , for they've become a part of m e .
Wh ile O s h i m a sleeps I sit on t h e porch , sip t e a , and read a book about
Napol eon's 1812 i nvasion of Russia. Some 400,000 Fre n ch soldiers lost th eir
l ives i n that h uge country i n th is massive , pointless campaign. The battles
themselves were awfu l , of course, but there weren't enough d o ctors or med­
i cal supplies, so most of the severely wounded soldiers were left to die i n
agony.More froze t o death or d i e d of starvation, equally te rrible ways t o die.
Seated there o n the porch , sipping hot herb tea, b i rds whistl i ng all around
m e , I tri ed to p i ctur e th e battlefield in Russia and these men trudging
through blizzards.
I get about a th i rd of the way through th e book and go ch e ck to see if
Osh ima's okay.I know he's exhausted, but h e 's so quiet it's l ike h e 's not even
th ere, and I'm a l ittl e worried. But he's all right, wrapped i n the cove rs,
breath ing qui etly.I walk ove r next to him and notice his shoulders rising and
falling slightly. Standing th ere, I suddenly remember that h e 's a wom a n .

32 3

Most of the time I forget that, and th ink of h i m as a m a n . Wh i ch is exactly
what h e wants,of course. But when he's sleeping,he looks l ike he's gone

back

to being a woman .
I go out on the porch again and p i ck up where I left off in the book. B a ck
to a road outside S molensk lined with frozen corpses .
Osh ima sleeps for a couple o f hour s . After h e wakes up h e walks o u t o n
t h e porch and l ooks at h i s car. T h e dusty,unpaved road has turned t h e green
M iata al most white. H e gives a big stretch and si ts down n ext to m e . " I t's the
ra iny season," h e says,rubbing his eyes,"but th ere's not much ra i n th is year.
If we don't get some soon,Takamatsu's going to run out of water."
I venture a questi o n : " Does M iss Saeki know where I a m ? "
H e shakes h i s head. "No, I didn't tell her anyth ing. S h e d o e s n ' t even
know I have a cab i n up here. It's better to keep her i n the dark,so she won't
get mixed up i n all th i s . The less she knows,the less she needs to h i d e . "
I nod. That's exa ctly what I wanted t o hear.
" S h e 's gotte n mixed up i n enough before," Osh ima says . " S h e doesn't
need th is now."
"I told her about my fath er dying recently," I tel l h i m . " How somebody
murdered h i m . I left out th e part about the pol i ce looking for me."
" S h e 's pretty smart. Even if neither of us mentioned it, I get the fee l i n g
s h e 's figured out m o s t of what's going o n . So if I t e l l h e r tomorrow t h a t you
had someth i n g you had to do and will be gone for a while, and tell her h i
from you ,I doubt she'll qu iz m e about the details. Even if that's a l l I tell her,
I know she'll j ust let it pass ."
I nod.
" B u t you want to see her,don't you?"
I don't reply. I ' m not sure how to express it, but th e answer isn't hard
to guess.
" I feel kind of sorry for you ," Oshima says,"but l ike I said,I th ink you two
shouldn't see each other for a wh ile."
" B u t I might n eve r see her aga i n ."
" Perhaps," Oshima admits , after giving it some thought. "Th i s is pretty
obvi ous, but until th i ngs happen , they haven't happen e d . A n d o fte n th i ngs
aren't what they seem."
"But how does M iss Saeki feel?"
Osh ima narrows h i s eyes and looks at m e . "About what?"
" I mean - if she knows she'll never see me aga i n ,does she feel the same
about me as I feel about her?"
Osh ima gri n s . "Why are you asking me th is?"

32 4

" I have no idea, w h i ch is probably why I'm asking you . Loving some­
body, wanting them more than anyth i ng - it's all a new experi e n ce . The
same with having somebody want

me.

"

"I imagine you 're confused and don't know what to do."
I nod. " Exa ctly."
"You don't know if she shares the same strong, pure fee l i ngs you have for
h er," Oshima comments .
I shake my h e a d . " I t h ur ts t o th ink about it."
Osh i ma's silent for a time as he gazes out at the forest, eyes narrowed .
B i rds are fl itti ng from one bra n ch to the next. H i s hands are clasped b e h i n d
h i s head. " I know how y o u fee l ," he fi n a l l y says . "But th is i s someth ing you
have to figure out on your own . Nobody can help you . That's what love's all
about, Kafka . You 're the one having those wonderful fee l ings, but you have to
go it alone as you wander th rough the dark. You r mind and body h ave to bear
it a l l . Al l by yourself."

It's after two when h e gets ready to l eave .
" I f you divide up the food," he tells me, " i t should last you a week. I ' l l be
back by the n . If someth ing comes up and I can't make it, I ' l l send my broth e r
here with suppl ies. H e o n l y l ives about an hour away. I 've t o l d h i m a b o u t you
being here. S o n o worries, okay?"
" Okay."
"And l ike I told you before, be extra cautious if you go i nto the woods.
If you get l ost, you'll never find your way out."
'Tl l be carefu l ."
"Just before World War II started, a large unit of Imperial troops carried
out some training exercises here, stagi ng mock battl es with the S oviet army i n
t h e S iberian forests . Did I tel l y o u th is already?"
"No."
" S eems l ike I forgot th e most i mporta nt th ing," Oshima says sheepishly,
tapping h i s temple.
" B u t th is doesn't look l ike S i berian forests," I say.
"You 're right. The trees here are all broadleaf types, the ones in those
forests would have to be evergreens, but I guess the milita ry didn't worry
about deta i l s . The point was to march into th e forest in ful l battle gear and
con d u ct their war games."
H e pours out a cup of the coffee I made from th e th ermos, spoons i n a
dollop of sugar, and seems pleased with th e results . "Th e milita ry asked my

32 5

great-gra ndfather to let th em use the mountain for their tra i n i ng, and he said
sure, be my guest. Nobody else was using it, after a l l . The unit marched up
the road we drove here on, then went into the forest. B u t when the exercises
were finished and they took roll call, they discovered two soldiers were miss­
ing. They'd j ust disappeared, full battl e gear and a l l , during the training, both
brand-new draftees. The army conducted a h uge search , but the two soldiers
never turned up." Osh ima takes another sip of coffe e . "To th is day n obody
knows if they si mply got l ost or ran away. The forest around here is i n c redibly
deep, and there 's hardly anyth ing you could forage for food."
I nod.
"Th ere's another world that parallels our own , and to a certain degree
you 're able to step i nto that other world and come back safely. As long as
you 're carefu l . But go past a certa i n point and you'll lose the path out. It's a
labyrinth . Do you know where th e idea of a labyrinth fi rst came from ? "
I shake m y head.
" I t was th e ancient Mesopotamians. They pulled out animal intestines ­
sometimes human i ntesti nes, I expect - and used th e shape to predict the
future . They admired the complex shape of i ntesti nes. So the prototype
for labyrinths is, in a word , guts . Wh i ch means that the pri n ciple for the
labyrinth is inside you . And that correlates to the labyrinth

outside ."

"Another metaphor," I comment.
"That's right. A reciprocal metaphor. Th i ngs outside you are pro j e ctions
of what's inside you , and what's inside you is a pro j ection of what's outs i d e .
So w h e n y o u step i nto t h e labyrinth outside you , at t h e same t i m e you 're
stepp ing into the labyrinth

inside. Most definitely a risky business."

" Sort of l ike Hansel and Gretel ."
" Right - j ust l ike the m . Th e forest has set a trap, and no matter what you
do, no matter h ow careful you are, some sharp-eyed birds are goi ng to eat up
all your bread cru mbs."
" I promise I'll be carefu l ," I tel l h i m .
Oshima lowers t h e top on the M iata a n d c l i mbs i n . H e puts o n h i s sun­
glasses and rests h i s hand on the gearshift. The forest e choes with the sound
of that familiar roar. He brushes back h i s hair, gives an abbreviated wave , and
is gone . Dust swirls around wh ere he was, but th e wind soon carries it away.
I go back inside the cab i n . I l i e down on the bed h e 'd been using and
shut my eyes. Come to th ink of it, I didn't get much sleep last night either.
The pillow and covers still show signs of Osh ima having been there . Not h i m ,
really - more l ike h i s

sleep. I s i n k down i n th ose signs. I 've slept for h a l f a n

h o u r w h e n there's a l o u d thump outside t h e cab i n , l ike a tree branch snapped

32 6

and tumbled to the ground. Th e sound j olts me awake. I get up and walk out
to the porch to have a look, but everyth ing looks the same. Maybe th i s is some
mysterious sound the forest makes from time to ti m e . Or maybe it was part of
a drea m . I can't tell one from the other.
Until the sun s inks down i n the west, I sit out on the porch , readi n g
my book.

I make a s i mple meal and eat it i n silence . Mte r cl earing away the dishes
I sink back i n the old sofa and th ink about Miss Saeki .
"Like Osh ima said, M iss Saeki's a smart person . Plus she has h e r own way
of doing th i n gs," the boy named C row says . He's sitting n ext to me o n the
sofa, j ust l ike when we were in my father's d e n . " She's very different from
you," h e tells me.
She's very different from you . She's overcome all kinds of obstacles ­
and not what you 'd call normal obstacles, either. She knows all kinds of
things you 're clueless about, she's experienced a range of emotions you 've
never felt. The longer people live, the more they learn to distinguish
what's important from what's not. She's had to make a lot of critical deci­
sions, and has seen the results. Again, very different from you . You 're only
a child who's lived in a narrow world and experienced very little. You 've
worked hard to become stronger, and in some areas you actually have.
That's a fact. B ut now you find yourself in a new world , in a situation
you 've never been in before . It's all new to you , so no wonder you feel
confused.

No wonder you feel confused . One th ing you don't understand very well
is wheth er women have sexual desire. Theoreti cally, of course they do. That
much even you kn ow. But when it comes to how th is desire comes about,
what it's l ike - you 're lost. Your own sexual desire is a simple matter. But
wome n 's desire, especially Miss Saeki's , is a total mystery. Whe n she held you
did she feel the same phys i cal e cstasy? Or is it someth i n g altogethe r different?
The more you th ink about it, th e more you hate being fi fte e n . You feel
hopeless. If only you were twenty - no , even

eig hteen would be good, a ny­

th ing but fi fteen - you could understand better what h e r words and a ctions
mean. Then you could respond th e right way. You 're i n th e middle of some­
th ing wonderful , someth i n g so tremendous you may never exper i e n ce it
aga i n . But YOll can't really understand how wonderful it i s . That makes you
i mpati ent. And that, i n turn , leads to despair.
You try to pi ctu re what she's doing right now. I t's Monday, and the

l ibrary's closed . What does she do on her days off? You imagine her alone i n
her apartment. She does the laundry, cooks, cl eans, goes o u t shopping - each
scene flashes in you r i magination. The more you imagi n e , the harder it gets
to sit still here. You want to turn into a dauntless crow and fly out of th is
cab i n , zoom out over these mountains, come to rest outside her apartment,
and gaze at her forever.
Perhaps she stops by th e library and goes into your roo m . She knocks but
th ere's n o answer. The door's unlocked . She discove rs you 're n o longer there .
The bed's made , and all your th ings are gone. She wonders where you di sap­
peared to . Perhaps she wa its a wh ile for you to come back , sitting at the desk,
head i n hands, gazing at

Kafka on the Shore. Th inking of the past th at's

e nveloped i n that painting. But no matter how long she waits, you don't
return. S h e finally gives up and leaves. She walks ove r to her Golf i n the park­
ing lot and starts the engine. The last th ing you want is to let her l eave l ike
th is. You want to hold her, and know what each and every movement of h e r
body m e a n s . But you 're n o t there . You're all a l o n e , i n a place cut off from
everyone.
You cl imb into bed and turn off the l ight, hoping that she'll show up i n

this room . It doesn't have t o b e the real M i s s Saeki - that fiftee n-year-old girl
would be fine. It doesn't matter what form she takes - a l iving spirit, a n illu­
sion - but you have to see her, have to have her beside you . You r bra i n is s o
ful l of her it's ready t o burst, your body about t o explode into p i e ces. Sti l l , no
matter h ow mu ch you want her to be here, no matter h ow long you wa it, she
n ever appears . All you hear is the fa int rustle of wind outs i d e , bi rds softly coo­
ing in the night. You hold your breath , staring off into th e gl oom. You l i sten
to the wind, trying to read someth ing into it, stra ining to catch a h i n t of what
it might mean. But all that su rrounds you are different shades of darkness .
Finally, you give up, cl ose your eyes, and fall asleep.

H

osh i n o l ooked u p rental car age n cies i n the Yel l ow Pages, p i cked
one at random, and phoned the m . "I j ust need a car for a couple of
days," h e explained, "so an ordi nary sedan's fine. Noth i n g too big,

nothing that stands out."
" Maybe I shouldn't say th is," the rental clerk said, "but s i n ce we only rent
Mazdas, we don't have a si ngle car that stands out. So rest assured."
"Great."
" H ow about a Familia? A ve ry reliable car, and I swear nobody will noti ce
it at all."
" S ounds good .The Familia it is." The rental age n cy was near the statio n ,
and Hosh i n o told the m he'd be over i n an hour t o p i ck up t h e ca r.
H e took a taxi over, showed th em his credit card and l i cense, th e n rented
the car for two days.The white Familia parked i n the lot was , as advertised,
totally unobtrusive. Turn away from it for a moment and every memory
of what it looked l ike vanished. A notable a ch i eve ment in the field of
anonymity.
Driving b a ck to the apartment, Hoshino stopped at a bookstore and
p i cked up maps of Takamatsu city and the Sh ikoku h i ghway syste m . He
popped i nto a C D shop nearby to see if they had a copy of B eethoven 's

Archduke Tri o , but the l i ttle shop had only a small class i cal s e ction and one
cheap, discount-b i n version of the piece .Not the M i l l io n-Dollar Tri o , u n for­
tunately, but H o s h i n o went ahead and paid h i s eight dollars.
B a ck in th e apartment, a sooth ing fragra n ce filled the place .Nakata was
bustl i n g around the kitchen preparing some steamed daikon and deep-fried
flat tofu ." I had noth i n g to do, so I made a few dishes," h e expla i n e d .
"That's great," Hoshino said. 'Tve b e e n eating out t o o much th ese days ,
and it'll be n i ce to have a home-cooked meal for a change. O h , hey - I got
the ca r. It's parked outside. Do you need it right away? "

32 9

" N o , tomorrow would be fine. Nakata has to talk more with the stone
today."
"Good idea. Talking thi ngs over is i mportant. Wheth e r you 're talking
with peopl e , or th i ngs, or whatever, it's always better to discuss th ings. You
know, when I ' m driving tru cks I often talk to th e engine. You can hear all
kinds of th i ngs if you l i sten closely."
" Nakata can't talk with engines, but it is important to discuss th i ngs ."
" S o how's it goi ng with the stone? You able to communicate ? "
"We 're starting to ."
"That's good. I was wondering - is the stone upset we brought it here? "
" N o , not at all . As far as I can make out, the stone doesn't much care
where it is."
"Whew - that's a reli ef," Hoshino sighed . "After all we've been through ,
if the stone turns on us we're up a creek."
Hosh i n o spent th e afternoon l i stening to his new C D. The performance
wasn't as spontaneous and memorable as th e one h e 'd heard in the coffee
shop. It was more restrained and steady, but overall not so bad . As he lay back
on th e cou ch and l istened, the lovely melody got to h i m , the subtle convolu­
tions of the fugue stirring up something deep inside.
If I 'd l i stened to th is mus i c a week ago , he told h i mself, I wouldn't have
understood th e fi rst th ing about i t - or even wanted to . But cha n ce brought
him to that l ittl e coffee shop, where he sank back i n that comfortable
chair, e n j oyed the coffee, and l i stened to the musi c. And now look at me,
h e thought, I'm i nto

Beethoven

-

can you believe it? A pretty amazing de­

velopment.
He played the piece over and ove r, testing out h i s newfound appre ciation

Archduke was defi nitely h i s favorite .

for mus i c. The C D contained a second B eethoven tri o , th e
a bad p i e ce , he th ought, though the

More depth , he con cluded. All th e wh ile, Nakata was off in a corner, fa cin g
t h e wh ite stone and muttering. Occasionally he'd nod or s cratch h i s head.
Two men off i n their own l i ttle worlds.
" Does th e mus i c bother you?" Hoshino asked h i m .
" N o , it's fi n e . M u s i c doesn't bother me. To me it's l ike t h e wind."
"The wind, h u h ? "
At six Nakata made dinner - grilled salmon and a salad, plus a number of
l ittl e side dishes h e 'd con cocted . Hosh ino switched on the 1V and watched
the n ews to see if there were any developments i n the murder cas e . But
there wasn't a word about it. Just other news - a kidnapping of an infant
girl , the usual Israe l i and Palestinian reprisals, a massive traffi c a ccident on a

h i ghway in western Japa n , a carjacking ring headed by foreigners, some
cabinet minister's stupid discrimi natory remark, layoffs at companies i n the
communication industry. Not a s i ngle upbeat story.
The two of th em sat at the table and ate th eir dinner.
"Th i s is really good , " Hoshino said. "You 're qu ite a cook. "
" M u c h obl iged . But you 're the first person I 've ever cooked for. "
"You 're tel l i ng me you never eat with friends or relatives or anybody? "
" Nakata knew many cats, but what we eat is very different. "
"We l l , yeah , " Hoshino said. "B ut, anyway, th is is delicious. Especially the
vegetables . "
'Tm happy you l ike it. Nakata can't read , so someti mes I make some
terrible mistakes i n the kitc h e n . So I always use the same i n gredients and
cook th i ngs the same way. If I could read, I could make all kinds of dif­
ferent dishes. "
"These are j ust fi n e . "
" M r. H o s h i n o ? " Nakata said in a serious ton e , sitting up stra ight.
"Yeah ? "
"Not being able to read makes l i fe tough . "
" I imagine so, " Hoshino sa id. "The commentary with th is C D says
B eethoven was deaf. H e was a famous composer, th e top pianist in E urope
when h e was young. But th en one day, maybe because of i l l ness, h e started to
go deaf. In th e end he couldn't hear a th ing. Pretty rough to be a composer
who can't hear. You know what I mean? "
" I th ink so. "
"A deaf compose r's l ike a cook who's lost h i s sense of taste . A frog that's
lost its webbed feet. A tru ck driver with his li cense revoked . That would th row
anybody for a loop, don't you th ink? But B eethoven didn't let it get to h i m .
Sure, h e must have b e e n a l ittl e depressed a t first, b u t he didn't l e t misfortu n e
g e t h i m down . I t w a s l ike,

Problem? What problem? H e composed m o r e than

ever and came up with better music than anyth ing he'd ever writte n . I really
admire the guy. Like th i s

Archduke Trio - h e was nearly deaf when he wrote

it, can you b e l i eve it? What I'm trying to say is, it must be tough o n you not
being able to read, but it's not the end of th e world. You might not be able to
read, but there are th i ngs only

you can do. That's what you gotta focus o n ­

your strengths . Like being able to talk with the stone."
"Yes, I a m able to talk with it a little now. Nakata used to be able to talk
with cats . "
" N o one else can do that, right? Other people can read all th e books they
want and they're still not gonna know how to talk to stones or cats . "

3 31

"These days , though , Nakata's having a lot of dreams. I n my dreams, for
some reason, I ' m able to read. I ' m not as dumb as I am now. I ' m so h appy and
I go to the l ibrary and read lots of books . And I ' m th inking h ow wonderful it
is to be able to read. I ' m readi ng one book after another, but th e n the l ight in
the l ibrary goes out and it's dark. Somebody turned off the l ight. I can't see a
th ing. I can't read any more books . And then I wake up. Even if it's only in a
dream, it's wonderful to be able to read."
" I n teresting . . . ," Hoshino said. "And here I ' m able to read and hardly
ever pick up a book. The world 's a mixed-up plac e , that's for sure."
"Mr. Hosh i n o ? " Nakata asked.
"What's up?"
"What day of the week is it today? "
" I t's Saturday."
" S o tomorrow would be Su nday?"
" Normal ly, yeah."
"Would you drive me tomorrow morning?"
" S ure, but where do you want to go?"
" Nakata doesn't know. I'll th i nk about it after I get i n the car."
" B e l i eve it or not," Hoshino said, " I had a fee l i n g that's what you were
goi ng to say."

Hosh i n o woke up the next morning j ust after seve n . Nakata was a l ready up
cooking breakfast. Hosh ino went to the bath room, sc rubbed h i s face with
cold water, and shaved with an electric razor. They breakfasted on rice, miso
soup with eggplant, dried mackerel, and pickles. Hosh i n o had a second help­
ing of rice.
Wh ile Nakata washed the dishes Hoshino watched the news on TV. Th is
time there was a short piece on th e murder i n Nakano. "Ten days have passed
since th e incident, but the police still have no leads," the N H K announcer
droned. An impress ive front gate of a house flashed o n the screen, cordoned
off, with a patrolman stationed outside.
"The search continues for the missing fifteen-year-old son of th e
deceased, though h i s whereabouts remain unknown . The search continues
as well for a man i n h i s s ixties who l ives in the neighborhood and stopped by
a pol ice station right after the incident to provide information regardi ng the
murder. I t rema ins unclear whether or not th ere is a connection between
these two peopl e . Because the inside of the house was undisturbed, the pol ice
believed that the crime was an act of personal revenge rath er than a robbery

" H ey, Cramps," Hoshino called out to Nakata i n the kitc h e n .
"Yes? What is it?"
"Do you know the son of th is guy that was murdered i n Naka n o ? Th i s
fifteen-year-ol d ? "
" N o , I d o n ' t . A s I told you , all Nakata knows about is J o h n n i e Walker and
h i s dog."
"Yeah?" H os h i n o repl ied. 'The police are looking for that boy, too . An
only c h i l d , it sounds l ike, and there's no mention of h i s m o m . I guess h e ran
away fro m home j ust before th e murder and h e 's still missing."
" I s that so . . . . "
"A hard nut to crack, th is murder," Hoshino said. " B u t the police are a
pretty tight-l ipped bunch - th ey always know more than they let o n . Accord­
ing to Colonel Sanders , they're on to you , and know you 're i n Takamats u .
P l u s they know s o m e handsome guy l ike me's with you . But they have n ' t
l eaked t h a t to t h e m e d i a yet. They're afraid if th ey let on we're here, w e ' l l
h i ghta il it somewhere else . That's w h y they're insisting t h e y don't know
where we are, publ icly. A del ightfu l bunch, cops."
At eight-th i rty th ey went out to the rental car and c l i mbed in. As he
settled down into the passenger seat, Nakata had h i s usual thermos of hot tea
with h i m , as well as h i s fa ithfu l shapeless hat, umbrella, and canvas bag. As
they were leavi n g the apartment Hosh ino was about to put on his C h u n i c h i
Dragons c a p w h e n h e glanced in t h e mirror and w a s brought up short. Th e
police must know the young guy they were looking for would be decked out
in a Dragons ball cap, green Ray-Bans, and an aloha shirt. There couldn't be
many people with D ragons caps on here in Takamats u , and add o n Ray-Bans
and the s h i rt and h e 'd stick out l ike a sore th umb. So that's why C olonel
Sanders stocked the place with i nconspicuous navy blue polo s h i rts - he
must've anticipated th i s . Nothing gets by h i m , Hoshino thought, and tossed
the sunglasses and cap aside.
" S o , where to ? " h e aske d .
"Anywhere is fi n e ," Nakata replied. "Just c i r c l e around the city."
"You sure ? "
"You can go wherever you l ike. I ' l l j ust e n j oy the scenery."
"Th is is a fi rst," Hoshino said. 'Tve done my share of driving - both in
the Self-Defense Force and with th e tru ck company - anel I ' m a decent
driver, if I say so myself. But every time I get behind the wheel, I know where

333

I ' m goi n g and beeline it right there . That's j ust th e way I a m , I guess.
Nobody's ever told me,

You can g o wherever you like - anywhere is {ine. You 're

kind of baffling me here."
" Nakata is very sorry."
" I t's okay - no need to apologize. I ' l l do my best," Hosh i n o s a i d . H e
slipped t h e C D of th e

Archduke Trio into the player. 'Til j ust drive all over

the city wh ile you e n j oy the view. Is that okay?"
"Yes, that would be fi n e ."
"I'll stop th e car when you find what you 're looking for. And then th e
story will devel op in a new direction. Do I have that right?"
"Yes, that's what might happen," Nakata said.
"Let's hope so," Hoshino said, and lII1folded the city map i n h i s l a p .

T h e two of the m drove through t h e city, Hosh ino marking each street on a
block to make sure they'd covered every one, th en heading over to the next.
They took an occasional break so Nakata could e n j oy a cup of tea , and
Hoshino a Marlboro . The

Archduke Trio played over and over. At noon th ey

stopped by a diner and had cu rry.
" B u t what the heck are you looking for?" Hoshino asked after they'd
eate n .
" I don't know. But I th ink - "
" - that you 'll know it when you see it. And until you see it, you won't
know what it is."
"Yes, that's correct."
Hosh ino shook his head l i stlessly. " I knew what you were gonna say, but
I j ust had to be sur e . "
" M r . Hoshino?"
"Yeah ? "
" I t might take s o m e t i m e before I find it."
"That's okay. We 'll do our best. The boat's left the dock, and we're stuck
o n it."
"Are we goi ng to take a boat?" Nakata asked.
" N o . No boats for the time being."
At three they went i nto a coffee shop, where Hosh i n o had a cup of coffe e .
Nakata puzzled over h i s order, finally goi ng with the i c e d m i l k . By th i s time
Hosh ino was exhausted from all the driving and didn't feel l ike talking. H e 'd
had h i s fill of B e ethove n . Driving around in a circle, getting nowhere, didn't
suit him. H e had to keep h i s speed down and pay carefu l attention to what h e

334

was doing, and he was getting bored. An occasional patrol car would pass by,
and Hoshino did his best to avoid eye contact. He also tried to avoid passi n g
in front of any police boxes. T h e Mazda Familia m i g h t be j ust a b o u t t h e most
inconspicuous car on the road, but if the pol ice spotted the same car pass­
ing by a few times they might very well pull him over. H e drove cautiously,
making absol utely sure he didn't rear-end anybody. An accident would put
eve ryth ing in j e opa rdy.
As H osh i n o drove around the city, checking the map as he went, Nakata
sat motionless, hands on the window, scanning the pass ing scenery, intently
searc h i n g for someth i ng, for all th e world l ike a child or a well-behaved dog.
They each concentrated on th eir task until evening, and hardly a word passed
betwee n th e m .

"What are you searching for? " O u t of desperation H o s h i n o started singing
an Inoue Yos u i tun e . H e couldn't recall the rest of the lyrics, so h e made
them up as h e went along.

Haven 't you found it yet?
The sun is soon setting . . .
And Hoshino's stomach is g rowling .
Driving round and round sets my head spinnin g .
They went back to the apartment at six.
" Let's continue tomorrow," Nakata said.
"We covered a lot of territory today. We can probably finish up the whole
city tomorrow," H osh ino said. " H ey - I got a question for you ."
"And what might that be?"
" I f you don't find what you 're looking for i n Takamats u , th e n what?"
Nakata gave his head a good rub . "If we can't find it i n Takamats u , th e n
w e ' l l have t o look farth er out."
"And if you still can't find it, then what're we supposed to do?"
" I f that happens, th en we have to search even more."
"We ' l l j ust make bigge r and bi gge r circles and eventually we'll find it.
Like th e saying goes, if a dog walks o n , it's bound to bump into a stick."
"Yes, I th ink that \vill happe n ," Nakata said. "But Nakata doesn't under­
stand. Why does a dog have to h i t a stick if it walks? If th ere 's a stick in front of
it, the dog can go around it."
Hosh i n o puzzled th is over. "Yeah , I guess you 're right. I never thought
about it before . . . . "
" I t's very strange."

3 35

" Let's put the dog and the stick aside for a minute, okay?" Hoshino said.
"That only compl i cates th ings. What I want to know i s h ow far are we going
to searc h ? I f we don't watch out, before we know it we'll wind up i n anoth e r
prefecture - Eh i m e or Koch i or someplace. Summer will be over and i t ' l l be
fal l by the n ."
"That may well be. But I have to find it, even if it's fal l or winter. I know
I can't ask you to help me forever. Nakata will j ust walk alone and keep on
search ing."
"Let's not worry about that for right now," Hoshino stammered. " B u t
c a n ' t t h e stone be a p a l a n d give us a hint or someth i ng? Even an approximate
location would help."
" Nakata's very sorry, but the stone doesn't say muc h . "
"Yeah, it doesn't strike me as t h e talkative type ," Hosh ino said . " I d o n ' t
i m a g i n e it's m u c h good at swimming, either. Whatever . . . We don't need to
th ink about it now. Let's get a good night's sleep and see what tomorrow
brings."

The next day it was the same routi ne, with Hosh i n o th is time circl ing the
western half of the city. By now his city map was full of yellow l i n e s . Only the
i n c reased number of yawns coming from the driver set th is day apart from
the previous one. Nakata kept his face plastered aga inst the window, i ntently
studying the pass ing scenery, and they hardly spoke . Whatever Nakata was
looking for, he didn't find it.
"Would today be Monday?" Nakata asked.
"Yllp . Yesterday was Sunday, s o today's Monday," Hosh ino said. The n ,
al most i n desperation, h e made up a melody t o s o m e words that popped into
his h ead :

If today is Monday,
tomorrow must be Tuesday.
Ants are hard workers, swallows like to dress up.
The chimney's tall, the setting sun red.
"Mr. Hosh ino," Nakata said after a wh i l e .
"Yeah?"
"You can look at ants working for a long time and n ever tire of it."
" I suppose you 're right," Hoshino repl ied.
At noon they stopped by a restaurant specializing i n eel and ordered the

lunch special , a bowl of rice topped with eel. At three they went to a coffee
shop, where Hosh i n o had coffe e , Nakata kelp tea . By six p . m . the map was a
mass of yellow marks, the anonymous tires of the Fam i l i a having trave rsed
every square i n c h of road i n the city. But still no luck.

What are you searching for? Hoshino sang aga i n i n a l istless voi c e :
Haven't you found it yet? / We 've g one everywhere in town. / My butt's aching ,
so can't we g o home?
After he fi n ished , h e sa i d , "We keep th i s up much longer, I ' l l turn i nto a
regular singer-so ngwriter," Hosh ino said.
"What would that be?" Nakata asked .
" Never m i n d . Just a harmless j oke."
Calling i t a day, they left the city, got on the h i ghway, and headed back to
the apartment. Lost in thought, Hosh ino fa iled to turn left when h e should .
He tried to get back on the h ighway, but th e road c ur ved off at a strange angle
into a maze of one-way streets and he was soon totally l ost. Before h e real ized
it they were i n a res idential area they'd never seen before , an old-looking, e l e­
gant neighborhood with h igh wa lls surrou nding the homes. The road was
strangely quiet, with not a soul i n sight.
" I don't th i n k we 're too far from our apartment, but 1 have n o idea where
we are ," Hosh i n o admitted . He parked th e car i n an e mpty lot, cut the
engi n e , set th e parking brake , and spread out his map. H e checked the name
of th e n eighborhood and street number on a nearby l i ghtpole and looked for
it on the map. Maybe h i s eyes were too tired, but he couldn't find it.
"Mr. Hosh i n o ? " Nakata asked.
"Yeah?"
'T m sorry to bother you , but what does i t say on that s ign over th ere on
th at gate ? "
Hosh i n o l ooked up from h i s m a p a n d gl anced where Nakata was point­
ing, down a h igh wall with an ol d-fashioned gate, and n ext to it a large
wooden s i gn . The black gate was shut tight.

"Komura Memorial Library, "

Hosh i n o rea d . " H u h , a l ibrary in th i s deserted part of town ? Doesn't even
l ook l ike a l i b rary. More l ike an old mans ion."

"Ko-mu-ra-Me-mori-al-Li-bra-ry? "
"You got it. Must be made to commemorate somebody named Komura.
Who th i s Komura guy i s , though , 1 have no idea."
"Mr. Hosh i n o ? "
"Yup?"
"That's it."
"What do you mean

-

that? "
337

"Th e place Nakata's been searching for."
Hoshino looked up from his map again and gazed i nto Nakata's eyes. H e
frowned, l ooked at th e sign, a n d slowly read it aga i n . H e patted a Marlboro
out of the box, put it between h i s lips, and lit it with his plastic l i ghter. He
slowly inhaled, the n blew smoke out the open window. "Are you sure ? "
"Yes, th is is it."

"Chance is a scary th ing, isn't it?" Hoshino said.
" I t certa inly is," Nakata agreed .

Chapter 3 9

M

y second day on the mountain passes b y leisurely, seamlessly. The
only th i n g that distinguishes one day fro m the n ext i s the weather.
I f the weath er was the same I couldn't tell one day fro m another.

Yesterday, today, tomorrow - th ey'd all blur i nto one. Like an a n c h o rless s h i p ,
time fl oats a i m l essly ac ross t h e broad sea.
I do the math and come up with today as Tuesday. The day M iss Saeki
gives a tou r of the l ibrary, provided th ere are any people who want to take
it. Just l ike the very fi rst day I came to th e place . . . . Spike heels c l i cking on
the stai rs , she walks up to the second floor, the sound reverberati n g through
the stillness. Her glistening stockings, bright wh ite blouse, tiny pearl ear­
rings, her Mont Blanc pen on top of her desk. Her calm s m i l e , ti nged with
the long shadow of resignation. Al l these deta ils seem so far away n ow - and
no longer real .
S i tting on the sofa i n the cab i n , the odor of the faded fabric all around
me, memories of our l ove making rise up i n my head. Miss Saeki slowly
re moving her clothes, getting into bed. My cock, not surpri s i n gly, i s rock hard
as th ese th oughts filter through my mind, but the tip's not red or sore any­
more and doesn't sting.
Tiring of th ese sexual fantas ies, I wander outside and go i nto my usual
exercise routi n e . I hang on to the porch ra i l i ng and go th rough a n ab work­
out. Then I do some quick squats, followed by hard stretc h i ng. By th i s time
I'm covered i n sweat, so I wet my towel i n the stream and wipe myself off.
The cold water helps calm my nerves . I sit down on the porch and l i sten to
Radiohead on my Walkma n . S i nce I ran away I 've been l istening to the same
music over and over - Radiohead's
C oltrane's

Kid A, Pri nce's Very Best of Sometimes

My Favorite Thing s .

At two p . m . - j ust when the l ibrary tou r is starti ng - I head o u t i nto the
forest. I follow the same path , walk for a wh i l e , and arrive at the clearing. I s i t
down on t h e grass, lean b a c k aga i nst a tree tru nk, and g a z e up at t h e round

339

opening of sky through the branches. The edges of wh ite summer clouds are
visible. Up to th is point, I'm safe . I can find my way back to the cab i n . A maze
for beginners - i f th is were a video game I 've easily cleared Level l . I f I go any
farth er, th ough, I 'll enter a more elaborate , more challenging labyrinth . Th e
path gets narrower and I ' l l get swallowed up by the sea of ferns.
I ignore th i s and forge on ahead.

I want to see how deep th is forest really is. I know it's dangerous, but I wa nt
to see - and feel - what kind of danger lies ahead, how dangerous it really i s .
I have to . Someth i n g's shoving me forward.
I cautiously go down a kind of path . The trees tower h igher and h igher,
the a i r growing denser by the minute. Up above , the mass of branches n early
blots out the sky. All signs of summer have vanished, and it's l ike seasons
n ever existe d . Soon I no longer know if what I'm fol l owing is a path o r not. It
l ooks l ike a path , is shaped l ike one - but th en aga i n it doesn 't, and isn't. In
the middle of all th is stuffy, overgrown greenery all definitions start to get a bit
fuzzy around the edges. What makes sense, and what doesn't, it's all mixed
up. Above me, a crow gives out a piercing caw that sounds l ike a warning, it's
so j arring. I stop and cautiously survey my surroundings . Without th e proper
equipment it's too dangerous to go any farth er. I have to turn aroun d .
Wh i c h i s n ' t easy. Like Napoleon's army on the retreat, goi ng back is
more difficult than going forward, I discover. The path back is misleading,
the dense vegetation forming a dark wall i n front of me. My own breath i n g
s o u n d s loud i n my ears, l ike a w i n d blowing at t h e e d g e of t h e worl d . A h uge
black butterfly about the size of my palm appears from the shade of the trees
and flutters i nto my line of sight, its shape reminding me of that bloodstain on
my T-sh irt. I t fl i es slowly across an open space, then disappears among the
trees aga i n , and once it vanishes everyth ing suddenly seems even more
oppressive, the air c h i l l ier. I'm seized by panic - not knowing h ow to get out
of here. The crow squawks out shrilly again - the same b i rd as before, sending
the same message . I stand still and look up, but can't see it. A breeze, a real
one, blows up from time to time, ominously rustl ing the dark l eaves at my
feet. I sense shadows racing past behind me, but when I spin around they've
h idden th emselves.
Somehow I'm able to make it back to my safety zone - th e l i ttle round
clearing i n the forest. I plop down on the grass and take a deep breath . I look
up at th e patch of real sky above me a couple of times, j ust to convi n c e myself
I 've made it back to the world I came from . S igns of summe r - so precious

now - surround m e . Sunl ight envelopes me l ike a fi l m , warming me up. But
the fear I fe lt c l i ngs to me l ike a clump of unmelted snow i n the corner of a
gard e n . My heart beats i rregularly from time to ti m e , and my ski n sti l l has
a slightly creepy fee l i ng.

That night I lie there i n th e darkness, breath ing qu i etly with my eyes wide
open, hoping to catch a figure appearing i n the dark. Praying for it to appear,
and not knowi ng if prayers have any effect. Concentrati ng for all I'm worth ,
wanting badly for it to happe n . Hoping that wanting it so badly will make my
wish come tru e .
B u t m y wish doesn't come true, m y desires are shot down . Like the n i gh t
before , M iss S a e k i doesn't show up. N o t the real M iss Saek i , not a n i l l u s i o n ,
n o t her as a fifteen-year-old girl . T h e darkness remains j ust that - darkness.
Right before I fal l asleep I have a massive erecti o n , harder than any I 've ever
had, but I don 't jack off. I 've made up my mind to hold the m e m o ry of mak­
ing love with M i s s Saeki untouched, at least for now. Hands clenched tight,
I fall asleep, hoping to dream of her.
Instead, I dream of Sakura .
Or is it a dream? I t's all so vivid , clear, and consistent, but I don't know
what else to call it, so dream seems th e best label . I'm i n her apartment a n d
she's asleep i n bed. I ' m i n my s l e e p i n g bag, j ust l ike that n i g h t I s p e n t at h e r
plac e . Ti m e 's been rewound, setting me down at a turning point.
I wake up in the middle of the night dying of th i rst, get out of my sleep­
ing bag, and drink some water. Glass after glass - five or six. My ski n 's c overed
with a sheen of sweat, and the front of my boxers i s tented in a n oth er h uge
erecti o n . My cock's l ike some ani mal with a mind of its own , operati ng on a
different wavelength from the rest of me. Wh en I drink some water my cock
automati cally absorbs it. I can hear th e fa int sound of i t soaking up the water.
I put th e glass next to the s i nk and lean back aga i nst the wall . I want to
check the time but can't find th e clock. In th is, the deepest hour of the n i ght,
even the clock's been swallowed up i n the depth s . I'm standing beside
Sakura's bed. Light from a streetl ight filters i n th rough th e c u rta i n . S h e 's fac­
ing away from me, fast asleep, her small, shapely feet sticking out from under
the th i n covers . B e h i n d me I hear a smal l , hard sound, l ike someone's turned
on a switc h . Th ick branches cut off my field of vision. There i s n o season
here. I make a decision and crawl i n next to Sakura . The s i ngle bed creaks
with the extra weight. I breathe i n the smell of the fa i ntly sweaty back of
her neck. Gently I wrap my arms around her. She makes a small sound but

continues to sleep. The crow squawks loudly. I glance up but can't spot the
bird. I can't even see the sky.
I pull up Sakur a 's T-sh i rt and fondle her soft breasts . I tweak h e r nipples
l ike I'm adj usti ng a radio dial . My rock-hard cock slaps agai nst th e back of her
th igh , but she doesn't make any noise and her breath ing stays the same. She
must be dreaming deeply, I figur e . Aga in the c row cries out, sending me a
message , but I can't figure out what it's trying to tell m e .
Sakura 's body is wa rm, a n d as sweaty as m i n e . I d e c i d e t o pull h e r
a r o u n d toward me, slowly p u l l i n g her closer so she's faceup. She exhales
deeply but still doesn't show any signs of waking. I rest my ear aga i nst her
paper-flat stomach, trying to catch the echoes of the dreams with i n that
labyrinth .
My erection's not l etti ng up, so rigid it looks l ike it'll last forever. I slip off
her small cotton panties, taking my time to get th em down h e r legs and off.
I rest my palm against her pubic hair, gently letti ng my fi nger go i n deeper.
It's wet, i nvitingly wet. I slowly move my finger. Still she doesn't wake up.
Lost i n h e r drea m , she merely exhales deeply aga i n .
A t t h e s a m e ti me, i n a hollow inside me, someth i n g struggl es t o break o u t
of its s h e l l . Before I real ize what's happe ning, th ere's a p a i r of eyes tu rned i n
on me, and I can observe th is whole scene. I d o n ' t yet know if th i s th i n g
i n s i d e me is good or b a d , but wh ichever it is, I c a n ' t hold it b a c k or stop it. I t's
still a sli my, faceless being, but it will soon break free of its shell, show its fac e ,
and slough off its j elly-l ike coating. Then I ' l l know what it really i s . N ow,
though, it's j ust a formless

sig n . It's reaching out its hands-that-won 't-be­

hands, breaki ng apart the shell at its softest point. And I can see each and
every one of its movements .
I make up my mind.
No, actually I haven't made up my mind about anyth ing. Making up
your mind means you have a choice, and I don't. I strip off my boxers, releas­
ing my cock. I hold Sakura, spread her legs, and slip i nside her. I t's easy ­
she's so soft and I ' m so hard . My cock no longer h urts . I n the past few days the
tip 's become even harder. Sakura's still drea ming, and I bury myself i n s i d e
her drea m .
Suddenly she snaps awake a n d realizes what's going o n .
" Kafka , what are YOli

doing ? ! "

" I t would seem that I ' m inside you ," I reply.
" B u t why?" she asks in a dry, raspy voi c e . "Didn't I tell YOli that's off
l i mits?"

342

" I can't help it."
" Stop al ready. Get it out of me ."
" I can 't," I say, shaking my head emphatically.
"Listen to m e . First of a l l , I 've got a steady boyfriend, okay? And second,
you've come i n to my dream without permiss i o n . That's not right."
" I know."
" I t's still not too late . You 're inside me, but you have n 't started moving,
you haven't come yet. It's just quietly inside m e , l ike it's th inking about some­
th ing. Am I right?"
I nod.
"Take it out," she admonishes m e . " And let's pretend th is n ever hap­
pened. I can forget it, and so should you . I ' m you r sister, and you 're my
brother. Even if we're not blood related , we're most definitely broth e r and
sister. You understand what I ' m saying? We 're part of a family. We shouldn't
be doing th i s . "
" I t's t o o late ," I tell her.
"Why?"
" B ecause I decided it is."
" Because you decided it is," says the boy named C row.
You don't want to be at the mercy of things outside you anymore, or
thrown into confusion by things you can't control. You've already mur­
dered your father and violated your mother-and now here you are inside
your sister. If there's a curse in all this, you mean to grab it by the horns
and fulfil l the program that's been laid out for you. Lift the burden from
your shoulders and live-not caught up in someone else's schemes, but as
you. That's what you want.

She covers her face with her hands and cries a little. You feel sorry for
her, but there's no way you're going to leave her body. Your cock swells up
inside her, gets even harder, l ike it's set down roots.
"I understand," she says. "I won't say any more. But 1 want you to
remember something: You're raping me. 1 l ike you , but this isn't how 1
want it to be. We might never see each other again, no matter how much
we want to meet l ater on. Are you okay with that?"
You don't respond. Your mind's switched off. You draw her close to
you and start to move your hips. Carefully, cautiously, in the end violently.
You try to remember the shapes of the trees to help you get back, but they
all l ook the same and are soon swallowed up in the anonymous sea. Sakura
closes her eyes and gives herself up to the motion. She doesn't say a word

343

or resist. Her face is expressionless, turned away from you. But you feel the
pleasure rising up in her like an extension of yourself. Now you under­
stand it. The entwined trees stand l ike a dark wall blocking your view. The
bird no longer sends its message. And you come.

I come.
And I wake up. I'm in bed, alone . It's th e middle of the night. Th e dark­
ness is as deep as it can be, all clocks lost with i n . I get out of bed, stri p off my
underpants, go over to th e kitchen, and rinse the semen off th e m . Gooey,
white, and heavy, l ike some illegitimate child born of the darkness. I gulp
down glass after glass of water, but noth ing slakes my th i rst. I feel so alone I
can't stand it. In the darkness, in the middle of th e night, surrounded by a
deep forest, I couldn't be more alone . There are no seasons here, no l ight. I
walk back to the bed, sit down , and breathe a h uge sigh . The darkness wraps
i tself around m e .
The thing inside YOll has revealed itself. The shell i s gone, completely
shattered, nowhere to be seen, and it's there, a dark shadow, resting. Your
hands are sticky with something-human blood, by the look of it. You
hold them out in front of you, but there's not enough l ight to see. It's far
too dark. Both inside, and out.

ext to the sign that read Komura Memorial Library was an informa­
tion placard informing th em that the l ibrary's h o u rs were eleven to
five , except for Monday, when it was closed, that admission was fre e ,

and that tours were conducted every Tuesday a t two p . m . Hosh i n o read all
th is aloud for Nakata .
"Today's M o nday, so it's closed," Hosh ino said. He glanced at h i s watc h .
"Not that it matters much, since it's way past their closing t i m e anyway. Same
difference."
" Mr. H o s h i n o ? "
"Yeah?"
"Th is place doesn't look at all l ike the l ibrary we went to before,"
Nakata said.
"That was a large publ i c l ibrary and th is one's private . S o the scale's
different."
"When you say a private l ibrary, what does that mean?"
" I t means some man of property who l ikes books puts u p a b u i l ding and
makes all the books h e 's coll ected available to the publ i c . Th is guy must
have really been someth ing. You can tel l from the gate h e had to be pretty
i mpressive ."
"What is a man of property? "
" A r i c h person."
"What's the difference between the two? "
H osh i n o tilted h i s h e a d i n thought. " I don't know. S e e m s t o m e a man o f
property's more cultured than j ust a regular r i c h guy."
" C ulture d ? "
"Anybody who has m o n e y is rich . You or me, as long as we had money,
we'd be rich . But becoming a man of property isn't so easy. It takes time."
" I t's diffi c u l t to become one?"

345

"Yeah , it is. Not that we need to worry about it. I don't see either of u s
b e c o m i n g rich, let alone cu ltured."
" M r. Hosh i n o ? "
"Yea h ? "
" S i n c e they're closed on Monday, if we c o m e here tomorrow m o r n i n g at
eleven they should be open, right?" Nakata asked.
"I suppose so. Tomorrow's Tuesday."
"Wil l Nakata be able to go inside the l ibrary?"
"The sign says it's open to everybody. Of cour s e you can."
" Even if I can't read?"
" N o proble m ," Hosh ino said. 'They don't quiz people at the entrance
about whether they can read or not."
" I want to go inside, then."
"We 'l l come back tomorrow, first th ing, and go i n together," H osh i n o
s a i d . " I g o t a question for y o u first, though. Th is is th e p l a c e y o u w e r e looking
for, right? And the thing you 're looking for's inside?"
Nakata removed h i s cap and rubbed h i s close-cropped h a i r vigorously.
"Yes. I think it's here."
" S o we can give up our searc h ? "
"That's right.T h e search is over."
"Thank God," Hoshino said. "I was starti ng to wonder if we'd really b e
driving around t i l l fall."

The two of them drove back to Colonel Sanders 's apartment, slept soundly,
and set off at eleven the next morning for th e l i brary. I t was only a twenty­
mi nute walk from the apartment, so they decided to stroll over. Hoshino had
al ready returned the rental car.
The gate of the l ibrary was open wide when they arrived. It looked l ike it
was goi ng to be a hot, humid day, and someone had splashed water on the
pavement to keep th e dust down. Past the gate was a neat, well-kept garden.
"Mr. Nakata?" Hoshino said in front of the gate.
"Yes, h ow can I help you ? "
"What do we do after we g o i n s i d e t h e l ibrary? I ' m always afra id you 're all
of a sudden gonna come up with some off-the-wall idea, so I 'd l ike to know
about it ahead of time. I have to prepare myself."
Nakata gave it some thought. "Nakata has no idea what to do once we get
in. Th is is a library, th ough, so I th ought we might start by reading books.

I ' l l find a photo collection or book of paintings , and you can p i c k whatever
you 'd l ike to read."
" Gotcha. Starting off by readi ng - that makes sense."
"Th e n after a while we can th ink about what to do next."
" Okay," Hosh i n o said. "We'll think about what comes late r - later.
Sounds l ike a plan."
They walked through the beautiful ga rden and into the antique-looking
entrance. There was a reception area right inside, with a handsome, s l i m
young m a n seated b e h i n d t h e counter. He h a d on a wh i te button-down s h i rt
and small glasses. Long, fine hair hung over h i s forehead. Someone you
might expect to see i n a black-and-wh ite Truffaut fi l m , H osh i n o thought.
The young man l ooked up at th em and beamed.
"Good morni ng," Hoshino said cheerfully.
"Good morning," the young man rep l i ed. "Welcome to the l ibrary."
"We 'd , u h - l ike to read some books."
"Of course ," Oshima n odded. " Feel free to read whatever you l ike. We 're
open to the publ i c. The stacks are completely ope n , so take any books you 'd
l ike to read. You can look books up in our card catalog or o n l i ne. And if you
have any questi ons, don't hesitate to ask. I 'd be more than happy to help."
"That's very kind of you. "
" I s there a parti cular field or book you 're looking for?"
Hosh i n o shook h i s head. "Not really. Actually we're more i n te rested in
the l i b rary itself than books. We happened to pass by and thought the place
looked i n teresti ng. I t's a beautiful buildi ng."
Oshima gave a graceful smile and picked up a neatly sharpened pencil.
"A lot of people j ust stop by l ike that."
"Glad to hear it," Hoshino said.
"If you have the time, you might consider the short tou r of the place that
takes place at two. We have one eve ry Tuesday, as long as there are people
who'd l ike to join in. The head of the l i brary explains the background of the
l ibrary. And today j ust happens to be Tuesday."
"That sounds l ike fu n. H ey, what d 'ya say, Mr. Nakata ? "
All t h e t i m e Hoshino a n d Osh ima h a d b e e n talking at t h e counter,
Nakata stood off to one s i d e , cap in hand, gazing vacantly at h i s surroundi ngs.
At the sound of h i s name, h e came out of h i s daze. "Yes, h ow can I help you ? "
"They have a tou r of t h e l i b rary at two. You want t o g o o n it?"
"Yes, Mr. H osh i n o , thank you. Nakata would l ike to."
Osh ima watched this exc hange with great interest. Messrs. H o s h i n o and

3 47

N akata - what sort of relationship did they have to each other? They didn't
seem l i ke relatives. A strange combo, these two - with a vast difference i n
a g e and appearance. What could they possibly have i n c o m m o n ? A n d th is
M r. Nakata , the older one, had an odd way of speaking.There was someth i n g
about h i m O s h i m a couldn't quite p i n down. N o t anyth ing bad, though.
" H ave you traveled far to get here?" he asked.
"We came from Nagoya," Hoshino said h u rriedly before Nakata could
open h i s mouth. I f he started in about being from Nakano, th i ngs could get a
l i ttl e sticky. The TV news had already put out the word that an old man l ike
Nakata was connected with the murder there. Fortunately, though , as far as
Hosh ino knew, Nakata 's photograph hadn't been made public.
"That's quite a j ou rney," Osh ima commented.
"Yes, we crossed a bridge to get here," Nakata said. "A long, wonder­
ful bridge."
" I t is pretty long, isn't it?" Oshima said. "Though I 've n ever been over
it myself."
" Nakata had never seen such a long bridge in all h i s l ife."
" I t took a lot of time and a tremendous amount of money to b u i l d it,"
Oshima went on. "According to the newspaper, each year the publ ic corpora­
tion that operates the bridge and th e highway over it is a b i l l i o n dollars in the
red. Our taxes make up the shortfal!."
" Nakata has no idea h ow much a billion is."
" I don't either, to tell you the truth," Osh ima said. "After a certa i n point
amou nts l ike that aren't real anymore. Anyway, it's a h u ge amount of
money."
"Thanks so much," Hoshino butted in.Th ere was no tel l i n g what Nakata
might say next, and he had to nip that possibility i n the bud. "We should be
h ere at two for the tour, right?"
"Yes, two would be fi n e ," Oshima said. "The head librarian will be happy
to show you around then."
"We ' l l be reading until then," Hoshino said.
Twi rl ing his pencil in his hand, Osh i ma watched the retreating figures
and then went back to work.

They picked some books from the stacks, Hosh ino going for Beethoven and

His Generation . Nakata picked out some photo coll ections and placed the m
on t h e table. Next, much l ike a d o g might, he circled t h e roo m , carefully
checking out everyth i ng, touching th ings, sniffing th eir odor, stopp ing at

select spots to stare fixed ly. They had the readi ng room to th emselves until
past twelve , so n o one else noticed th e old man's eccentric behavior.
" H ey, Gramps? " Hoshino whispered.
"Yes, h ow may I help you ? "
"Th is is k i n d of sudden, b u t I 'd appreci ate it if you wouldn't mention to
anyone that you're from Nakano."
"Why is that? "
" I t's a long story, j ust take my word for it. If people find out that's where
you're from , it might cause them some troubl e . "
" I understand," Nakata said, nodding deeply. " I t's not good to trouble
othe rs. Nakata won't say a word about being from Nakano."
"That'd be great," H osh ino said. "Oh - did you find whatever i t is you're
looking for?"
" N o , noth i ng so far. "
"But th is is definitely th e place?"
Nakata nodded. " I t i s . Last night I had a good talk with the sto n e before
I went to bed. I'm sure th is is the place."
"Thank God."
Hosh i n o nodded and returned to h i s b i ography. Beethove n , he learn e d ,
w a s a proud m a n who bel ieved absolutely in h i s own a b i l i t i e s and never both­
ered to flatte r the nobility. B e l i eving that art itself, and the proper express ion
of emotions, was the most sublime th ing i n the world , h e thought political
power and wealth served only one purpose: to make art possible. Whe n
Haydn boarded with a n o b l e fami ly, as h e did m o s t of h i s professional l i fe , h e
had t o e a t with t h e servants . Musicians of Haydn's generation were consid­
ered employe e s . (The unaffected and good-natured Hayd n , though , much
preferred th is arrangement to the stiff and formal meals put on by the nob i l ity.)
Beethove n , in contrast, was enraged by any such contemptuous treatment,
on occasion smash ing th i ngs against the wall i n anger. H e ins isted that as far
as meals went he be treated with no less respect than the nobil ity he ostensi­
bly serve d . H e often flew off the handle, and once angry was hard to calm
down. On top of th is were radical pol itical ideas that h e made n o attempt to
h i d e . As h is hearing deteriorated, these tendencies became even more pro­
nounced. As h e aged his mus i c also became both more expans ive and more
densely i nward looking. Only Beethoven could have balanced these two
c ontrasti ng tendenci es. But the extraordi nary effort th is requ i red had a pro­
gressively del eterious effect on his l i fe , for all humans have physical and e m o­
tional l i m i ts , and by th is time the composer had more than reached h is.
Geniuses l ike that don't have it easy, Hosh i n o thought, i mpressed,

349

and l a i d down h i s book. He remembered th e bronze bust of a scowl i n g
B eethoven i n t h e music room of his school, but u n t i l n ow h e 'd had n o i d e a
of th e hardships t h e man h a d endured. No wonder t h e g u y l ooked so sour.

I 'm never gonna be a genius, that's for sure, Hosh i n o thought.
He l ooked over at Nakata, who was deep into a photo collection of
traditional folk fu rnitur e , and working an imaginary c h isel and plane. These
photos must've made him unconsciously feel l ike h e was back at h i s old j ob.
And Nakata - wh o knows? He might become a great person someday,
Hoshino thought. Most people can't do the kinds of th ings h e does. Th e old
codger's defi nitely i n a class all h i s own.
After twelve , two other readers, middle-aged wome n , came i nto the read­
ing roo m , so Hoshino and Nakata used the opportunity to take a breathe r out­
side. Hoshino had brought some bread along for th eir l u n c h , wh i l e Nakata
was l ugging around his usual thermos of hot tea. Hoshino fi rst asked Osh ima
at the counter whether it was all right to eat on the l ibrary grounds.
"Of course," Osh ima repl ied. "It's nice to sit on th e veranda overlooking
the garden. Afterward , feel free to come in for a cup of coffee. I 've a l ready
made some, so help yourself."
"Thanks ," Hoshino said. "Th is is qu ite a homey place you have h e re."
Oshima smiled and brushed back h i s hair. "It is a l i ttle different from
your normal l ibrary. Homey is a good way to describe it. What we 're tryi ng to
create is sort of an inti mate space where people can relax and e n j oy reading."
Hosh ino found Oshima an appealing young man. I ntell i gent, well
groomed, obviously from a good family. And quite kind. H e 's got to be gay,
right? Not that Hoshino cared. To each h i s own , was h i s th inking. Some men
talk with stones, and some sleep with other men. Go figure.
After l u n c h , H osh ino stood up, stretched his whole body, th en went back
to the reception area to take Osh ima up on h i s offer of a cup of coffee. S i n c e
Nakata didn't d r i n k coffee, he stayed on th e veranda s i p p i n g h i s t e a and
gazing at the birds fl itting around the garden.
" S o , did you find anyth ing interesti ng to read?" Oshima asked H osh i n o.
"Ye a h , I've been reading a biography of B eethove n ," Hoshino repl ied.
" I l ike it. His l i fe really gives you a lot to th ink about."
Oshima nodded. " H e went through a lot - to put it mildly."
" H e did have a tough time," Hosh ino sa id, "but I th ink it was mainly h i s
fault. I m e a n , h e was so self-centered a n d uncooperative. A l l h e thought
about was h i mself and his mus i c , and he didn't mind sacrificing whatever he
had to for it. H e must've been tough to get along with. Hey, Ludwig, gimme a

break! That's what I would have said if I knew h i m. No wonder h i s nephew

went off h i s rocker. But I have to admit his mus ic is wonderfu l. It really gets to
you. It's a strange th i ng."
"Absolutely," Oshima agreed.
" B u t why did h e have to l ive such a hard, wild l i fe ? He would 've been
better off with a more normal type of l i fe ."
Oshima twi rled the pencil around in h i s fingers. " I see your point, but by
Beeth oven 's time people thought it was important to express th e ego. Earl ier,
when there was an absolute monarchy, th is would 've been considered
i mproper, socially deviant behavior and suppressed quite severely. Once the
bourgeoisie came to power i n the n i neteenth century, h owever, that suppres­
sion came to an end and the individual ego was l iberated to express itself.
Freedom and th e emancipation of the ego were synonymous. And a rt, music
i n particular, was at the forefront of all th is.Those who came after B eethoven
and l ived under his shadow, so to speak - Berl ioz, Wagner, Liszt, S c h u­
mann - al l l ived eccentric, stormy lives. Eccentri city was seen as al most the
ideal l ifestyle.The age of Romanti cism, they called it.Though I ' m sure l iving
l ike that was pretty hard on th em at times. S o , you l ike Beethove n 's mus i c ? "
" I c a n ' t really s a y if I do or not. I haven't h eard that m u c h ," H o s h i n o
admitted. " Hardly any at a l l , actual ly. I j u s t kind of l ike t h a t p i e c e called the

Archduke Trio."
"That is n i c e , yes."
"The M i l l ion-Dollar Trio's great," Hoshino added.
" I prefe r the Czech group, the Suk Tri o , myself," Oshima sa i d . "They
have a beautifu l balance.You feel l ike you can smell the wind wafting over a
green meadow. But I do know the M i l l ion-Dollar Tri o version - Rubinste i n ,
Heifetz , and Fe uermann. I t's an el egant performance."
" U m , M r.- Os h i m a ? " Hoshino asked, looki ng at the nameplate on the
counter. "You know a lot about mus i c , I can tell."
Oshima smiled. "Not a lot. I just en joy l istening to i t."
" D o you think music has the power to change peopl e ? Like you l isten to
a piece and go through some major change inside?"
Oshima nodded. " S ure, that can happen . We have an expe rience - l ike a
chemical reaction - that transforms something inside us. Wh e n we examine
ourselves later o n , we discover that all the standards we've l ived by have shot
up anoth er notch and the world's opened up i n u n expected ways. Yes , I 've
had that experie nce. Not ofte n , but it has happened. I t's l ike fal l i n g in l ove."
Hoshino had n ever fallen head over heels in l ove h i mself, but he went
ahead and nodded anyway. "That's gotta be a very i m portant th ing, right?" h e
said. " For our l ives ? "

35 1

" I t i s ," Osh ima answered. "With out th ose peak experiences our l ives
would be pretty dull and flat. Berlioz put it th is way: A l i fe without once read­
ing Hamlet is l ike a l i fe spent in a coal mine."
"A coal m i n e ? "
" J u s t typical nineteenth-century hyperbole."
"We l l , thanks for the coffee," Hosh ino said. 'Tm happy we could talk."
Osh ima gave h i m a big grin in reply.

Hoshino and Nakata read books until two , Nakata going through h i s carpen­
ter's motions as h e leafed through the collection of fu rniture photographs.
Besides the middl e-aged ladies, three other readers had j oined the m after
l u nch. But only H osh ino and Nakata asked to join the tour of the l ibrary.
"You don't mind if it's j ust the two of us?" Hoshino asked. "I fee l bad you
have to go to all th is trouble j ust for us."
"No trouble at a l l ," Oshima sa id. "The head l ibrarian is happy to conduct
the tour, even for one person."
At two on the dot a good-looking middl e-aged woman came down the
sta i rs. Back held stra ight, she had an impressive walk. She wore a dark blue
s u i t with severe l i nes, black high heels, a th i n s i lver necklace at h e r w i d e ,
open neckl i n e , her hair gathered in t h e back. Noth ing extraneous, altogeth e r
a h ighly refined, tastefu l look.
" H e l l o. My name is Miss Saeki. I'm th e head l ibrarian h e re ," the woman
said, and smiled calmly.
''I'm Hosh i no."
'Tm Nakata, and I'm from Nakano," the old man sa i d , hiking hat i n
hand.
"We're glad you've come to visit us from so far away," M iss Saeki said.
A c h i l l ran down Hoshi no's spine at Nakata's words, but M iss Saeki didn't
look suspicious.
Nakata was typ ically oblivious."Yes, I crossed ove r a very big bridge ,"
he said.
"Th i s is a wonderful buildi ng," Hosh ino interjected , trying to cut off any
talk of bridges.
"The bu ilding was built in the early Mei j i period as the l i brary and guest­
house of the Komura family," Miss Saeki began. "Many l i terati visited and
l odged h e re. It's been designated a historical site by the c ity."

"Litter oddy?" Nakata asked.

M iss Saeki smil ed. "Artists - poets, novelists, and so forth. I n the past
men of property i n various local ities helped support artists. Art was different
back th e n , and wasn't viewed as someth i n g one should make a l iving at. The
Komuras were men of property i n th is region who sponsored c u l tu re and the
arts. Th is l ibrary was b u ilt, and is operated, to pass down that l egacy to future
generati ons."

"Man of property- Nakata knows what th at means," N akata said. " I t
takes a l o n g t i m e t o become one."
S m i l i ng, M iss Saeki nodded. "You're quite right, it does. No matter how
much money you accumulate, you can't buy time. Wel l , we ' l l begin our tour
on th e second floor."

They toured the rooms upsta i rs one by one. Miss Saeki gave h e r usual talk
about the various l i terati who had stayed th ere, and showed the two men the
call igraphy and painti ngs th ese arti sts had left behi nd. D u r i n g the tour
Nakata seemed to turn a deaf ear to what she was sayi ng, i nstead curiously
examining each and every item. I n th e study Miss Saeki used as h e r offi c e , a
fountain pen was sitting on the desk. It was up to Hoshino to fol l ow along and
make all the appropriate noises. Al l the wh ile he was on p i n s and needles,
worried th e old man would suddenly do someth i ng bizarre. B u t all Nakata
did was continue to scrutinize the items th ey passed by. M iss Saeki didn't
seem to care what Nakata did. Smiling all the wh i l e , she briskly s h owed th e m
around. Hosh i n o w a s i mpressed b y how c a l m and collected she was.
The tour ended i n twenty minutes , and the two men thanked their guide.
M iss Saeki 's smile n ever fa iled th e entire time. The more Hosh i n o watched
her, th ough , the more confused he grew. She smiles and l ooks at u s , h e told
h i mself, but she doesn't see anyth ing. She's looking at us, but s h e 's seeing
someth i n g else. Though all the time she was giving the tour, even if h e r m i n d
w a s elsewhere, she w a s perfectly polite and kind. Wh enever h e a s k e d a ques­
tion , she gave a kind, easy-to-follow response. It's not l ike s h e 's doing th i s
aga inst h e r w i l l or anyth i ng. A part of her en joys d o i n g a meticulous job. B u t
her heart isn't i n i t.
The two men returned to the reading room and settled down on the sofa
with their books. But as he turned the pages, Hosh i n o couldn't get M iss Saeki
out of h i s mind. There was someth ing very unusual about that beautifu l
wom a n , but h e couldn't quite p u t h i s finger on it. H e gave u p and w e n t back
to reading.

35 3

At three o'clock, totally without warning, Nakata stood up. H i s move­
ments were uncharacteristically decis ive. He held his hat firmly i n his hand.
" Hey, what's up? Where are you goi ng?" Hosh ino whispered.
But the re was no response. Lips set in a determined look, Nakata was
al ready h u rrying toward the main entrance, his belongings left b e h i n d on
the floor.
Hoshino shut h i s book and stood up. Someth i n g was defi nitely wrong.
" H ey, wa it up ! " he call ed. Realizing the old man wasn't about to, he scram­
bled after h i m. The other readers looked up and watched him l eave.
Before he got to the entrance, Nakata turned left and without hesitating
started up to the second floor. A

N O VISITORS ALLOWED BEYOND THIS POINT

sign at the foot of the sta i rs didn't deter h i m , since he couldn't read. H i s worn
tennis shoes squeaked on the floorboards as h e c l i mbed up the stairs.
" Excuse me," Osh ima sa id, leaning over the counter to call out to th e
retreating figure. "That area is closed now."
Nakata didn't seem to hear h i m.
Hosh i n o ran up the sta irs after h i m. "Cramps. I t's c losed. You can't
go there."
Oshima came out from behind th e counter and fol l owed them u p
t h e stairs.
Undaunted, Nakata strode down th e corridor and into the study. The
door was open. Miss Saeki , her back to the window, was s i tting at the desk
reading a book. She heard the footsteps and l ooked up. Whe n h e got to the
desk, Nakata stood there looking down at her face. Neither one of the m said
a word. A moment later Hoshino arrived, soon fol l owed by Oshi ma.
"Th e re you are," Hoshino said, tapping the old man on the shoulder.
"You're not supposed to be here. It's off-l imits. We have to leave, okay?"
" Nakata has someth i ng to say," Nakata said to Miss Saeki.
"And what would that be?" Miss Saeki asked quietly.
"I want to talk about the stone. The entrance stone."
For a wh ile Miss Saeki silently studied the old man's face. H e r eyes shone
with a noncommittal l i ght. She bli nked a few times, then s i l e ntly closed h e r
book. S h e rested both h a n d s on t h e desk a n d looked u p aga i n at Nakata. S h e
l ooked undecided about how t o proceed, b u t then gave a s m a l l nod.
She l ooked over at Hosh ino, then at Oshi ma. "Would you mind leaving
us alone for a wh i l e ? " she said to Oshi ma. "We're goi ng to have a talk. Please
close the door on your way out."
Osh i ma hesitated , th en nodded. He gently took Hoshino's arm, led h i m
o u t t o the corridor, a n d shut th e door.

35 4

"Are you sure it's okay?" Hosh ino asked.
" M iss Saeki kn ows what she's doing:' Oshima said as he escorted
H osh ino back down the sta irs. "If she says it's all right, i t's all right. No need
to worry about her. S o , Mr. Hosh ino, why don't we go have a c u p of coffee
while we 're waiting? "
"We l l , when it comes to Mr. Nakata, worrying's a total waste of t i m e ,"
H osh i n o said, shaking h i s head. "That I can guarantee."

Chapter 41

W

hen I go into the woods th is time I've outfitted myself with every­
th ing I might need: compass , knife , cante e n , some e m e rgency
food, work gloves, a can of yellow spray paint, and th e small

hatchet I'd used before . I stuff all th is into a small nylon daypack that was also
i n the tool shed, and head off into the forest. I'm wearing a long-sleeved s h i rt,
a towel wrapped around my neck, and the cap Osh ima gave me, and I've
sprayed insect repellent over all the exposed parts of my body. The sky's over­
cast, and i t's hot and sticky l ike it could ra in any minute, so I th row a poncho
into the pack j ust i n case . A flock of b i rds screech at each oth e r as they cut
ac ross the low, leaden sky.
I make it easily to that round clearing in the forest. C h ecking my com­
pass to make sure I'm generally heading north , I step deeper into the woods.
Th is time I spray yellow markings on tree tru nks to mark the route . Unl ike
Hansel and Gretel's bread crumbs, spray paint's safe from h u n gry b i rds.
I'm better prepare d , so I'm not as afra i d . I'm nervous, sure, but my heart's
not pounding. C u riosity's what's leading me o n . I want to know what l ies
down th is path . Even if there's nothing there , I want to know that. I have to
know. Memorizing the scenery as I pass by, I move steadily forward, step by
careful step.
Occasionally there's some weird sound. A th ud l ike someth i n g h i tting
the ground, a creak l ike floorboards groaning under weight, and others I can't
even describe . I have no idea what these mean , since there's no knowing what
they are . Sometimes they sound far away, sometimes right near by - the sense
of distance expanding and contracting. B i rd wings echo above m e , sounding
louder, more exaggerated, than they should. Every time I hear th is I stop and
l i sten intently, holding my breath , wa iting for som eth ing to happen . Noth i n g
d o e s , a n d I walk o n .
B e s i d e s these sudden, unexpected sounds, everyth ing e l s e is sti l l . There's

no wind, no rustle of leaves in the treetops, j ust my own footsteps as I push
through the brush. Wh en I step on a fallen bra n c h , the snap reverberates
through the air.
I grasp th e hatchet, which I 'd sharpened, and it feels rough i n my glove­
less hands. Up to this point it hasn't come in handy, but i ts heft is comforti ng,
and makes me feel protected. But from what? Th ere aren ' t any bears or
wolves i n th is forest. A few poisonous snakes , perhaps. Th e most dangerous
creature h ere would have to be me. So maybe I 'm j ust scared of my own
shadow.
Still, as I walk along I get the feeling someth ing, somewhere , is watc h i n g
me , listening t o me, h olding its breath , blending i nto t h e backgrou n d , watch­
ing my every move. Somewhere far off, someth ing's listening to all the sounds
I make, trying to guess where I 'm headed and why. I try not to th ink about it.
The more you th ink about illusions, the more they'll swell up and take o n
form.A n d no longer be an illusion.
I try wh istling to fill in th e s ilence. The sopran o sax from C oltran e 's "My
Favorite Th ings , " though of course my dubious whistling doesn't c ome a ny­
where near the complex, lightning-qu ick original. I j ust add b its so what I
h ear in my head approximates the sound. Better than noth i ng, I figure. I
glance at my watc h - it's ten-th irty. Osh ima must be getting the library ready
to open. Today would be ... Wednesday. I pi cture h im sprinkling water in
the gard e n , wiping off the desks with a cloth , boili ng water and brewing up
some coffee.All the tasks I normally take care of. But now I'm h ere , deep in
the forest, heading even deeper. Nobody has any idea I 'm h ere. The o nly
ones who do are me , and them .
I continue down the path. Calling it a path , though , isn't qu i te right. It's
more like some natural kind of channel that water's carved out over time.
Whe n there's a downpour i n the forest, rushing water gouges out the dirt,
sweeping the grasses before it, exposing the roots of trees. Wh e n i t h its a
boulder it makes a detour around it. Once the ra i n lets up you 're left with
a dry riverbed that's someth ing like a path. Th is pseudo-path is c overed with
ferns and gree n grass, and if you don't pay attention you 'll lose it e n tirely. I t
gets steep every o n c e i n a wh ile , a n d I scramble up b y grabbing h o l d o f
tree trunks.
Somewhere along the line Coltra ne's soprano sax runs out of steam. N ow
i t's McCoy Tyn er's piano solo I hear, the left hand carving out a repetiti ous
rhythm and th e right layeri ng on th ick, forb idding chords. Like some myth i c
s c e n e , t h e mus i c portrays somebody's - a nameless, faceless somebody 's-

357

dim past, all the details la id out as clearly as entrails being dragged out of the
darkness. Or at least that's how it sounds to me. The patient, repeatin g music
ever so slowly breaks apart the real, rearra nging the pieces. I t has a hypnoti c ,
menacing smell, just like t h e forest.
I h ike along, spraying marks on the trees as I go , sometimes turning to
make s ure these yellow marks are still visible. It's okay - th e marks that lead
me h ome are like an uneven line of buoys in the sea. Just to be doubly sure,
every once i n a wh ile I hack out a notch i n a tree trunk. My little hatchet isn't
very sharp , so I pick out the th inner, softer-looking tru nks to hack. Th e trees
receive these blows i n silence.
H uge black mosqu itoes buzz me like reconnaissance patrols , a iming for
the exposed skin around my eyes. Wh en I hear their buzz I brush them away
or squash them. Whe never I smush one it makes a squ i s h , already bloated
with blood it's sucked out of me. It feels itchy only later. I wipe the blood off
my hands on the towel around my neck.
The army marching through these woods , if it was summer, must have
had the same problems with mosqu itoes. Full battIe gear - how much would
that have weigh e d ? Those old-style rifles like a clump of iro n , ammunition
belt, bayonet, steel h elmet, a couple of grenades, food and rations, of course,
entrenching tools to dig foxholes, mess kit ... All that gear must add up to
well over forty pounds. Damn heavy, and a lot more than my little daypack. I
have the disti nct feeling I 'm going to bump i n to those soldiers around the
n ext bend, even though they disappeared here more than s ixty years ago.
I remember Napoleon's troops marching into Russia in the summer of
1812. They must have swatted away their share of mosqu itoes, too , on that

long road to Moscow. Of course mosqu itoes weren't the only problem. They
had to struggle to survive all kinds of other th i ngs - h u nger, th irst, muddy
roads, infectious disease, sweltering heat, C ossack commandos attacking
their th i n supply lines, lack of medical suppli es, not to mention h u ge battles
with the regular Russ ian army. When the French forces fi nally straggled
i nto a deserted Moscow, their number had been reduced from 500,000 to a
mere 100,000.
I stop and take a swig of water from my canteen. My watch shows exactly
eleven o 'clock. The library is just opening up. Osh ima's unlocking th e door,
taking his usual seat behind the counter, a stack of long, neatly sharpened
pencils on the desk. H e picks one up and twirls it, gently pushing the eraser
end against his temple. I can see it all clearly. But that place is so far away.
I 've never had peri ods, says Osh ima. I do anal sex and have never used
my vagina for sex. My clitoris is sensitive but my breasts are n ' t.

I remember Osh ima asleep in the bed in the cab i n , h i s fac e to the wall.
And the signs h e/she left behind. Cloaked in those signs, I went to sleep i n
the same bed.
I give u p th inking about it anymore. I nstead I th ink about war. The
Napoleonic Wars , the war the Japanese soldiers had to go off a n d fight. I feel
the heft of the hatchet i n my hands. That pale , sharp blade gli n ts and I h ave
to turn my eyes away from it. Why do people wage war? Why do h u n dreds of
thousands, eve n millions of people group together and try to a n n i h ilate each
other? Do people start wars out of anger? Or fear? Or are anger and fear j ust
two aspects of the same spirit?
1 hack another notch i n a tree with my hatchet. The tree cries out

silently, bleeding invisible blood. 1 keep on trudging. C oltran e p i cks u p h i s
soprano sax aga i n. O n c e more the repetition breaks apart t h e real, rearran g­
ing the p i eces.
Before long my mi nd wanders i nto th e realm of dreams. They c ome back
so qu ietly. I 'm holding Sakura. She's in my arms , and I 'm i n s i d e her. 1 don't
want to be at the mercy of th i ngs outside me anymore , thrown i n to confusion
by th ings 1 can ' t control. I 've already murdered my father a n d vi olated my
mother - and n ow h ere I am inside my s ister. If there's a c urse in all th i s , I
mean to grab it by the horns and fulfill the program that's been la i d out for
me. Lift the burden from my shoulders and live - not caught up i n someone
else's schemes , but as me. That's what 1 really want. And I come inside her.
" Even if i t's in a dream, you shouldn't have done that, " the boy named
Crow calls out. H e 's right behind me , walking in the forest. "I tri ed my best to
stop you. 1 wanted you to understand. You heard , but you didn't liste n . You
j ust forged on ahead."
I don't respond or turn around, j ust silently keep on trudging.
"You thought that's h ow you could overcome the curse, right? But was
it? " Crow asks.
But was it? You killed the person who's your father, violated your
mother, and now your sister. You thought that would put an end to the
curse your father laid on you, so you did everything that was prophesied
about you. But nothing's really over. You didn't overcome anything. That
curse is branded on your soul even deeper than before. You shoul d realize
that by now. That curse is part of your DNA. You breathe out the curse, the
wind carries it to the four corners of the Earth, but the dark confusion
inside you remains. Your fear, anger, unease-nothing's disappeared.
They're all still inside you, still torturing you.

"Listen u p - there 's no war that will end all wars , " Crow tel l s me. "War

35 9

breeds war. Lapping up the blood shed by violence, feeding on wounded
flesh. War is a perfect, self-contained being.You need to know that."
"Sakura - my s ister, " I say. I shouldn't have raped h er. Even if it was in

a dream . "What should I do? " I ask, staring at the ground i n front of me.
"You have to overcome the fear and anger inside you , " the boy named
C row says. "Let a bright light shine in and melt the coldness i n your h eart.
That's what being tough is all about. Do that and you really will be the tough­
est fifteen-year-old on the planet. You followi ng me ? There 's still time. You
can still get your self back. Use your h ead. Th ink about what you 've got to
do. You 're no dunce.You should be able to figure it out."
"Did I really murder my father? " I ask.
No reply. I swing around, but the boy named Crow is gone and the
silence swallows my question.
Alon e i n such a deep forest, the person called me feels empty, h orribly
empty. Osh ima once used the term hollow men . Well, that's exactly what I 've
become. There's a void inside me , a blank that's slowly expanding, devouring
what's left of who I am. I can hear it happening. I 'm totally lost, my identity
dying. There's no direction wh ere I am, no sky, no ground. I th ink of Miss
Saeki , of Sakura , of Oshima. But I 'm light-years away from them. I t's like I 'm
looking through the wrong end of a pair of binoc ulars , and no matter how far
I stretch out my hand, I can't touch them. I 'm all alone in the middle of a dim
maze. Listen to th e wind, Osh ima told me. I liste n , but no wind's blowi n g.
Even the boy named Crow has vanished.

Use your head. Think about what you've got to do.
But I can't th ink anymore . No matter h ow much I try, I wind u p at a dead
end i n the maze. What is it inside me that makes up me? I s this what's sup­
posed to stand up to the void?
If only I could wipe out th is me who's here , right h ere and right now. I
seriously consider it. In th is th ick wall of trees, on th is path that's not a path , if
I stopped breath ing, my consciousness would silently be buried i n th e dark­
ness, every last drop of my dark violent blood dripp ing out, my DNA rotting
among the weeds. Then my battle would be over. Otherwise , I 'll eternally be
murdering my father, violating my moth er, violati ng my s ister, lashing out at
the world forever. I close my eyes and try to find my center. The darkness that
covers it is rough and j agged. There's a break i n the dark clouds, like looking
out the window to see the leaves of the dogwood gleaming like a thousand
blades i n the moonlight.
I feel someth ing rearranging itself under my ski n , and there's a tinkling
sound i n my h ead. I open my eyes and take a deep breath. I throw away the

can of spray paint, the hatchet, the compass. From far away I hear them all
clatter to the ground. I feel lighter. I slip the daypack off my shoulders and
toss it asi de. My sense of touch seems suddenly acute. The air around me's
grown more transparent. My sense of the forest has grown more i n te nse.
C oltrane's labyrinth i n e solo plays on in my ears , n ever endin g.
Th inking it over, I reach i nto the daypack and take out the h u nting knife
and stuff it in my pocket. The razor-sharp knife I stole from my father's desk.
If need be, I c ould use it to slash my wrists and let every drop of blood inside
me gush out onto the ground.That would destroy the device.
I head off i n to the h eart of the forest, a hollow man , a void that devours
all that's substantial. There is noth i ng left to fear. Not a th i n g.
And I head off into the heart of the forest.

Chapter 42

O

nce the two of them were alone, M iss Saeki offered Nakata a cha ir.
He thought about it for a moment before s i tting down. They sat
there for a time without speaking,eyeing each other across the desk.

Nakata placed h i s hiking hat on his lap and gave h i s short hair a good rub
with h i s hand. M iss Saeki rested both hands on th e desktop,qu ietly watc h i n g
h i m g o through h i s routine.
"Unless I 'm mistaken, I th ink I 've been wa iting for you to come,"
she said.
"I believe that's true," Nakata replied. "But it took some time for Nakata
to get h ere. I hope I didn't make you wa it too long. I did my best to get h ere as
quickly as I could."
Miss Saeki shook her head. "No,it's perfectly all right. I f you'd come any
earlier, or any later, I would've been even more at a loss,I suppose. For me,
right n ow is the perfect time."
"Mr. Hoshino was very kind to me and helped me out a lot. I f I had to do
it alon e it would've taken even longer. Nakata can't read,after all."
"Mr. Hoshino is your friend, isn ' t he? "
"Yes," Nakata repli ed, and nodded. "I th ink he is. But to tell th e truth,
I 'm not all too sure about that. Besides cats, I 've never had what you would
call a friend i n my life."
"I haven't had any friends either, for quite some time," M iss Saeki said.
"Oth er than i n memories."
"Miss Saeki? "
"Yes ? " she replied.
"Actually,I don't have any memories eith er. I 'm dumb,you see,so could
you tell me what memories are like? "
Miss Saeki stared at her hands on the desk, then looked up at Nakata
aga i n. "Memories warm you up from the ins ide. But they also tear you apart."

Nakata sh ook h i s head . "That's a tough one. Nakata still doesn't understand. The only th i n g I understand is the present. "
'Tm the exact opposite , " Miss Saeki said.
A deep silence settled over the room.
Nakata was the one who broke it, lightly clearing his throat. "Miss Saeki? "
"Yes ? "
"You know about the entrance stone, don't you ? "
"Yes, I d o , " she said. She brushed the Mont Blanc pen on the desk with
her fingers . "I happened to come across it a long time ago . Perhaps it
woulcl've been better if I 'd never known about it. But I had n o choice i n the
matter. "
"Nakata opened it again a few days ago . The afternoon when there was
lightning. Lots of lightning falling all over town . Mr. H o s h i n o h elped me .
I could n ' t have done it myself. Do you know the day I 'm talking about? "
Miss Saeki nodded . "Yes, I remember. "
"I opened it because I had to . "
"I know. You did that so th i ngs would be restored to th e way they
should b e . "
It was Nakata's turn to nod. "Exactly. "
"And you had the right to do it. "
"Nakata doesn't know about that. In any case, it wasn't someth ing I
chose . I have to tell you th is - I murdered someone in Nakano . I didn't want
to kill anybody, but Johnnie Walker was i n charge and I took the place of the
fifteen-year-old boy who should've been there , and I murdered some o n e .
Nakata had to do it. "
Miss Saeki closed her eyes, then opened them and looked h i m in the
fac e . "Did all that happen because I opened the entrance stone a long time
ago? Does that still have an effect eve n now, distorting things? "
Nakata shook h i s head. "Miss Saeki? "
"Yes? " s h e s a i d .
"Nakata d o e s n ' t know a b o u t that. My role is t o restore what's h ere n o w to
the way it should b e . That's why I left Nakano, went across a h uge bridge , and
came to Sh ikoku . And as I 'm sure you 're aware, you can't stay h ere anymore . "
Miss Saeki smile d . "I know, " she said. "It's what I 've been hoping for, Mr.
Nakata , for a long time . Someth ing I longed for i n the past, what I 'm longing
for right now. No matter how I tri ed, though , I couldn't grasp it. I simply had
to sit and wa i t for that time - now, i n other words - to come . I t wasn ' t always
easy, but suffering is someth ing I 've had to accept. "

" M iss Saeki , " Nakata said, "I only have half a shadow. The same as you."
" I know."
" Nakata lost it during that war. I don't know why that had to happen, and
why i t had to be me....At any rate , a long time has passed since the n , and it's
nearly time for

us

to leave here."

"I understand."
" Nakata's l ived a long time, but as I said, I don't have any memori es. So
th is 'suffering' you talked about I don't rightly u nderstand. But what I th ink
is - no matter h ow much suffering you went through , you never wa n ted to let
go of those memories."
"That's true , " Miss Saeki said. " I t hurt more and more to hold on to
them, but I never wanted to let them go, as long as I was al ive. It was the only
reason I had to go on l iving, th e only th ing that proved I was al ive."
Nakata nodded silently.
"Living longer than I should have has only ru ined many people and
many th ings, " she went on."Just recently I had a sexual relationship with th at
fifteen-year-old boy you me ntioned. I n that room I became a fifteen-year-ol d
girl aga i n , a n d made love t o him. I d o n ' t know if that w a s t h e right th ing t o d o
o r n o t , but I c o u l d n ' t help it. But those actions must surely have c a u s e d some­
th ing else to be ru ined. That's my only regret."
" Nakata doesn't know about sexual desire. Just l ike I don't have memo­
ries, I don't have any desire. So I don't understand the difference between
right or wrong sexual desire. But if someth ing did happe n , i t happened.
Whether i t's right or wrong, I accept everyth ing that happens, and that's h ow
I became the person I am now."
"Mr. Nakata? "
"Yes ? "
" I have a favor to ask." M iss Saeki picked up the bag at her feet, took
out a small key and unl ocked a desk drawer, th en pulled out some th ick fi l e
fol ders and l a i d them on top o f the desk.
" Ever since I came back to th is town , " she said, 'Tve been writing th is. A
record of my l i fe. I was born nearby and fell deeply in love with a boy who
l ived i n th i s house. I couldn't have loved him more , and h e was deeply in
l ove with me. We l ived i n a perfect circle, where everyth ing i n s i d e was com­
plete. Of course that couldn't go on forever.We grew up, and times cha nged.
Parts of the circle fel l apart, th e outside world came rushing into our private
paradise , and th i ngs inside tried to get out. All quite natura l , I suppose, yet at
the time I couldn't accept it. And that's why I opened up th e entrance
stone - to prevent our perfect, private world from collapsi ng. I can't remem-

ber now h ow I managed to do it, but I decided I had to open the sto n e no mat­
ter what - so I would n 't lose h im, so th ings from the outs i d e wouldn ' t destroy
our world . I didn't understand at the time what it would mea n . And of course
I received my punishment. "
She stopped speaking h ere , picked up the fountain p e n , and closed her
eyes. "My life ended at age twe nty. S ince th en it's been merely a series of end­
less reminiscences, a dark, winding corridor leading nowhere . N everth eless, I
had to live it, s urvivi ng each empty day, seeing each day off still empty. Dur­
ing those days I made a lot of mistakes. No, that's not correct - sometimes I
feel that a ll I did was make mistakes. I felt l ike I was livi ng at the bottom of a
deep well, completely shut up inside myself, cursing my fate , hating every­
th ing outs i d e . Occasionally I ventured outside myself, p u tting on a good
show of being alive . Accepting whatever came along, numbly slipping
through life . I slept around a lot, at one point even l iving i n a sort of marriage ,
but it was all pointless. Everyth ing passed away in an instant, with noth i n g left
behind except th e scars of th i ngs I i n j ured and despised . "
S h e la id her hands on top of th e three files on her desk. "All th e deta ils
are i n h ere . I wrote th is to put it all in order, to make sure one more time
about the life I live d . I have only myself to blame , but i t's a gut-wren c h i n g
process. A n d I 've fi nally finished it. I 've written everyth i n g I need to write . I
don't need th is anymore , and I don't want anybody else to read it. If someone
else happened to see it, it might cause harm all over aga i n . S o I want i t all
burned up, every last page , so noth i ng's left. If you wouldn 't mi n d , I 'd like
you to take care of it. You're the only person I can depend on, Mr. Nakata .
I 'm sorry to bother you with th is, but could you do it for me ? "
" Nakata understands, " he said, nodding seri ously. "If that's what you'd
like, Miss Saeki, I 'll be happy to burn it all up for you. You can rest assur e d . "
"Thank you, " Miss Saeki said.
"Writing th ings was important, wasn 't it? " Nakata aske d .
"Yes, i t w a s . T h e process o f wri ting was important. E v e n th ough the
finished product is completely meaningless . "
" I can't read or write, so I can't write th i ngs down . Nakata's j ust like a cat. "
" Mr. Nakata ? "
" H ow can I h elp you? "
" I feel like I 've known you for ages, " Miss Saeki said. "Weren ' t you in that
painting? A figure i n the sea i n the background? White pants l egs rol l e d u p ,
dipping your feet i n t h e water? "
Nakata silently stood up and came over to stand in fro n t of M iss Saeki .
He laid h i s hard , sunburned hands on top of h ers on the file s . And as if

l istening carefully to someth ing, he felt th e warmth there fi l ter from her hand
to h is. " M iss Saeki? "
"Yes? "
"I th ink I understand a l i ttle now. "
"About what? "
"What memories are . I can feel them, through your hands. "
She smi led. ''I 'm glad. "
Nakata kept h i s hands on top of hers for a long while. Eventually Miss
Saeki closed her eyes, quietly giving herself over to memories. There was n o
more pain there , for someone h a d siphoned it off forever. T h e circ l e was
once aga i n complete . She opens the door of a faraway room and finds two
beautifu l chords , in the shape of l izards, asleep o n the wall. She gently
touches them and can feel their peaceful sl eep. A gentle wind i s blowing,
rustl ing the old c urtain from time to time . A significant rustl ing, l ike some
parable. S h e 's weari ng a long blue dress. A dress she wore somewhere a long
time ago . Its hem swishes fa intly as she walks . The shore is visible outside the
window. And you can hear the sound of waves , and someone's voice. Th ere 's
a h i n t of the sea in the breeze. And it's summer. Always it's summer. Small
white clouds are etched against the azure sky.

Nakata carried the three th ick files downsta irs. Osh ima was at the counter
talking with one of the patrons. When he saw Nakata, h e gri n ned. Nakata
gave a polite bow i n return , and Oshima went back to his conversati o n .
H o s h i n o w a s i n t h e reading room a l l t h e wh i l e , d e e p i n a book.
"Mr. Hoshino? " Nakata said.
Hosh ino laid h i s book down and looked up. " H ey, that took a while. You
all finished? "
"Yes, Nakata's all finished here . If it's all right with you , I was th inking we
can leave pretty soon. "
" F i n e by me. I'm nearly finished with th is book. B eethoven j ust died, a n d
I ' m at t h e part a b o u t t h e fu neral . Man, what a fu neral ! Twe n ty-five thousand
Viennese j oined the procession, and they closed all th e schools for the day. "
" Mr. Hoshino? "
"Yeah, what's up? "
"I have one more favor to ask of you. "
" Sh oot. "
" I need to burn th is somewhere . "

Hoshino looked at the files the old man was carrying. "Hmm, that's a
lot of stuff. We can't j ust burn it anywhere. We 'd need a dry riverbed or
someplace."
"Mr. Hoshino? "
"Yeah ? "
"Let's go fi n d one then."
"Maybe th is is a stupid questi on, but is that really so important? C a n ' t we
j ust toss i t somewhere ? "
"Yes, it's very important and we have to burn it all up. It has to turn i n to
smoke and rise i n to the sky. And we have to watch it, to make sure it all
burns up."
Hosh i n o stood up and stretched. "Okay, let's find a big riverbed. I h ave
no idea where , but I 'm sure S h ikoku's gotta have at least one - if we look long
enough."

The afternoon was bus ier than it had ever been. Lots of people came to use
the library, several with detailed, specialized questions. I t was all Osh ima
could do to respon d , and to run around collecting materials that had been
requested. Several items h e had to locate on the computer. Normally h e 'd ask
M iss Saeki to h elp out, but today it didn't look like h e 'd b e able to. Various
tasks took h i m away from h i s desk and he didn't even notice wh e n Nakata
left. Whe n th i ngs settled down for a momen t h e looked aro u n d , but the
strange pair was n owhere to be seen. Osh ima walked upsta irs to Miss Saeki's
study. S trangely, the door was shut. He knocked twice and waited, but there
was n o response. H e knocked aga in. "Miss Saeki? " he said from outside the
door. "Are you all right? "
He softly turned the knob. Th e door was unlocke d . Osh ima opened it a
crack and peeked inside. And saw Miss Saeki facedown on the d esk. H er hair
had tumbled forward , h iding her face. H e didn't know what to do. M aybe she
was j ust tired a n d had fallen asleep. But h e 'd never once seen her take a nap.
She wasn 't the type to doze off at work. H e walked into the room and went
over to the desk. H e leaned over and whispered her name i n h er ear, but got
n o response. H e touched her shoulder, the n h eld her wrist and pressed h i s
fi nger aga inst it. Th ere was no pulse. H e r s k i n reta ined

a

fa i n t warmth , but i t

w a s already fading away.
He lifted her hair and ch ecked her face. Both eyes were slightly open.
She looked like she was having a pleasant dream, but she was n ' t. S h e was

dead. A fa int trace of a smile was still on her lips. Even in death she was grace­
ful and dignified, Osh ima thought. He let her hair fal l back and p i cked u p
t h e p h o n e on t h e desk.
H e 'd resigned h imself to the fact that it was only a matter of time before
th i s day came . But now that it had, and he was alone in th is qu iet room with
a dead M iss Saek i , he was lost. He felt as if h i s h eart had dried up. I needed
her, h e thought. I needed someone l ike her to fill the void inside me . But I
wasn't able to fi l l the void inside her. Until the b i tter e n d , the empti ness
inside h er was h ers alone.
Somebody was calling out his name from downsta irs . H e felt l ike h e 'd
h eard that voi c e . H e 'd left th e door wide open and could h ear the sounds of
people bustl ing aroun d . A phone rang on the first floor. He ignored it a l l . H e
sat down a n d gazed a t Miss Saeki . You want t o call m y name , h e thought, go
right ahead . You want to call on the phone - be my guest. Finally h e heard an
ambulance siren that seemed to be getti ng closer. I n a few momen ts people
will be rushing upstairs to take h er away - forever. H e ra ised his left arm and
glanced at h i s watc h . I t was 4:35. 4:35 on a Tuesday afternoon . I have to
remember th is time , h e thought. I have to remember th is day, th is afternoon ,
forever.
"Kafka Tamur a , " he wh ispered, staring at the wal l , "I have to tel l you
what happened. I f you don't already know. "

Chapter 43

W

ith all my baggage gone I can travel l ight n ow, forgi n g on deeper
i n to the forest. I focus totally on movi ng forward . N o need to
mark any more trees, no need to remember the path back. I d o n 't

even look at my surroundings. The scenery's always the same, so what's the
point? A canopy of trees towering above th ick ferns, vi nes tra i l i n g down ,
gnarl ed roots , l umps of decaying leaves, the dry, sloughed-off skins of various
bugs. H ard , sti cky spiderwebs. And endless branches - a regular tree branch
u nivers e . Menacing branches, branches fighting for spa c e , c leverly h i dden
branches, twisted, crooked branches, contemplative branches, dried-u p ,
dying branches - t h e same scen ery repeated aga i n and aga i n . Though with
each repetition the forest grows a bit deeper.
Mouth tightly shut, I continue dmvn what passes for a path . I t's ru n n i n g
uph i l l , but not so steeply, at l e a s t for now. Not t h e kind of slope that's goi ng t o
g e t me out of breath . Sometimes t h e path threatens t o g e t l o s t i n a sea of ferns
or thorny bushes, but as long as I push on ahead the pseudo-path pops up
aga i n . The forest doesn't scare me anymore . It has its own rules a n d patterns,
and once you stop being afra id you 're aware of them. Once I grasp these rep­
etitions, I make them a part of me .
I'm empty-handed now. The can of yellow spray paint, the l i ttle hatchet­
they're h istory. The daypack's gone as well . No canteen, no foo d . Not even
the compass . One by one I left these beh i n d . Doing this gives a visible mes­
sage to the forest: I 'm not afraid anymore. That's why I chose to be totally

defenseless. M i nus my hard shel l , just flesh and bones, I h ead for the core of
the labyrinth , giving myself up to the void.
The mus i c that had been playing i n my head has vanished, leaving
behind some fa i n t white noise l ike a taut white sheet on a h uge bed. I touch
that sheet, tracing it with my fingertips. The wh ite goes on forever. Sweat
beads up under my arms . Sometimes I can catch a glimpse of the sky through
the treetops . I t's covered with an eve n , unbroken l ayer of gray clouds, but it

doesn't l ook l ike it's goi ng to ra in. Th e clouds are sti l l , the whole scene u n­
changi ng. B irds in the h igh branches call out cl ipped , meaningful greetings
to each oth er. Insects buzz proph etically am ong the weeds.
I th ink about my deserted house back in Nagata. Most l ikely i t's all shut
up n ow. Fine by me.Let the bloodsta ins be.What do I care? I 'm never going
back there. Even before that bloody incident took place, that house was a
place where lots of th i ngs had died. C h eck that - were murdered.
Sometimes from above me , sometimes fro m below, the forest tries to
threaten me. Blowing a chill breath on my neck, sti nging l ike needles with a
thousand eyes. Trying anyth i ng to drive th is intruder away. But I gradually get
better at l etti ng these threats pass me by. Th is forest is bas ically a part of me ,
isn't it? Th is thought takes hold at a certain point. The j ourney I'm taking is

inside me. Just l ike blood travels down veins, what I 'm seeing i s my i n n er self,
and what seems threatening is j ust th e echo of the fear in my own h eart. The
spiderweb stretched taut th ere is th e spiderweb inside me. The birds calling
out overhead are birds I 've fostered in my mind. These images spri ng lip i n
m y mi nd and take root.
Like I 'm being shoved from behind by some h uge h eartbeat, I continue
on and on through the forest. The path leads to a special place, a l ight source
that spins out the dark, the place where soundless echoes come from. I need
to see with my own eyes what's there. I'm carrying an important, sealed, per­
sonal letter, a secret message to myself.
A question. Why didn't she love me ? Don't I deserve to have my moth er
l ove me ?
For years that questi on's been a white-hot flame burning my heart, eati n g
away at m y s o u l . There h a d t o be someth ing fu ndamentally wrong with m e
t h a t made m y mother not love m e .Was th ere someth ing inherently polluted
about me ? Was I born j ust so everyone could turn their faces away from me?
My mother didn't even hold me close wh en she left. S h e turned h er fac e
away and left h ome with m y si ster without saying a word. S h e disappeared
l ike quiet smoke.And now that face is gone forever.
The b irds screech above me aga i n , and I look up at the sky. Noth ing
there but that flat, express ionl ess layer of gray clouds. N o wind at all. I trudge
along. I 'm walking by the shores of consciousness. Waves of consciousness
roll in, roll out, leave some wri ting, and just as quickly new waves roll i n and
erase it. I try to qui ckly read what's written there , between one wave and the
next, but it's hard. Before I can read it the next wave's washed it away. All
that's left are puzzling fragments.
My mi nd wanders back to my house on the day my mother left, taking

my sister with h er. I 'm sitting alone on the porc h , staring out at the garden.
It's twilight, i n early summer, and the trees cast long shadows . I 'm alone in
the house. I don't know why, but I already knew I was abandoned. I under­
stood even then h ow th is would change my world forever. Nobody told me
th is - I j ust knew it. The house is empty, deserted , an abandoned lookout post
on some far-off frontier. I'm watching th e sun setting i n the west, shadows
slowly stealing over the world . In a world of time, noth i n g can go back to the
way it was . Th e shadows' feelers steadily advance, eroding away one point
after another along the ground, until my mother's fac e , there u n til a moment
ago, is swallowed u p i n th is dark, cold realm. That hardened fac e , turned
away from me , is automatically snatched away, deleted from my memory.
Trudging along in the woods, I th ink of M iss Saeki . Her fac e , that calm,
fa int smile , th e warmth of h er hand. I try imagi ning her as my moth er, leav­
ing me beh i n d when I was four. Without realizing it, I shake my head. The
picture is all wrong. Why would Miss Saeki have done that? Why does she
have to hurt me , to permanently screw lip my life ? There had to be a h i d d e n ,
important reason , someth ing deeper I 'm j ust n o t getti ng.
I try to feel what she felt th en and get closer to her viewpoint. I t isn't
easy. I'm the one who was abandoned, after all, she's the o n e who did the
abandoning. But after a wh ile I take leave of myself. My soul sloughs off the
stiff cloth es of th e self and turns into a black crow that s its th ere o n a branch
h i gh up i n a p i n e tree in the garden, gaz ing down at the four-year-old boy on
the porc h .
I turn i nto a th eorizing black crow.
" I t's not that your moth er didn't love you , " the boy named Crow says
from behind me . " S he loved you very deeply. The first th ing you h ave to do is
beli eve that. That's your starting point. "
" B u t she abandoned me . She disappeared, leavi ng me alone wh ere I
shouldn't be. I 'm finally begi nning to understand h ow muc h that h urt. H ow
could she do that if she really loved me? "
"That's the reality of it. It did happen , " the boy named Crow says . "You
were h urt badly, and those scars will be with you forever. I feel sorry for you , I
really do. But th ink of it like this: I t's not too late to recover. You 're young,
you 're tough . You 're adaptable . You can patch up your wounds, lift up your
head, and move o n . But for her that's not an opti o n . The only th i n g she 'll
ever be is lost. It doesn't matter whether somebody j u dges th i s as good or
bad - that's not the point. You 're the one who has the advantage . You ought to
consider that. "
I don't respond .

" It all really happe ned, so you can't undo it, " C row tel ls me . " S h e
shouldn't have abandoned you then, a n d you should n 't have been aban­
doned. But th i ngs i n the past are l ike a plate that's shatte red to pieces. You
can n ever put it back together l ike it was, right? "
I n o d . You can never put it back together like it was. H e 's h i t the nail on
the head.
The boy named C row continues. " Your moth er fel t a gut-wren c h i n g kind
of fear and anger inside her, okay? Just like you do now. Wh i c h is why she had
to abandon you."
" Even though she loved me ? "
" Even though she loved you , she had to abandon you . You need to
understand h ow she felt th en, and learn to accept it. Understand the over­
powering fear and anger she expe rienced, and feel it as you r own - so you
won't inherit it and repeat it. The ma in th ing is th is: You have to forgive her.
That's not going to be easy, I know, but you have to d o it. That's the only way
you can be save d . There 's no other way ! "
I think about what h e 's said. The more I th ink about it, the more con­
fused I get. My head's spinning, and I feel l ike my skin's being ripped away.
" Is M iss Saeki really my mother? " I ask.
" D i d n 't she tell you that theory is still fu nctional ? " the boy named C row
says . " S o that's the answer. It's still a functioning hypothesis. That's all I can
tel l you . "
"A working hypothesis until some good counterevidence comes along. "
"You got it, " C row says .
"And I have to pursue that hypothesis as fa r as it'll take me . "
'That's it, " C row repl ies poi ntedly. "A th eory that sti l l doesn't have any
good cou nterevidence is one worth pursuing. And right now, pur s u i n g it's
the only choice you have . Even if it means sacri ficing your s e l f, you have to
pursue it to the b i tter e n d . "
" Sacrifice myself? " That certa inly has a strange ring to it. I can't qu i te
grasp it.
Th ere 's no reply. Worried, I turn around. The boy named C row is stil l
th ere . H e 's right b e h i n d , keeping pace.
"What sort of fear and anger did Miss Saeki have at that time ? " I ask h im
as I turn back around and walk on. "And where did it come from? "
"What kind of fear and anger do you th ink she had? " the boy named
C row asks i n return. "Th ink about it. You 've got to figure it out yourself.
That's what your head's for. "
So I do just that. I have to understand it, accept it, before it's too late . B u t

I still can't make out that deli cate writing left on the shore of my conscious­
ness. There's not e nough time between one wave and the next.
'Tm i n love with Miss Saeki , " I say. The words slip out naturally.
"I know that, " the boy named Crow says curtly.
'Tve never felt that before , " I go o n . "And it's more important to me than
anyth ing else I 've ever experi enced . "
"Of course i t is, " Crow says . "That goes without sayi ng. That's why you 've
come all this way. "
" B u t I still don't get it. You 're telling me my mother loved me very muc h .
I wa nt t o beli eve you , b u t if that's true , I j ust don't get i t . Why does loving
somebody mean you have to h ur t th em just as muc h ? I mean , if that's th e way
it goes, what's the point of loving someone? Why the h ell does it have to be
like that? "
I wa it for an answer. I keep my mouth shut for a long time , but there 's n o
response, so I spin around. T h e b o y named Crow is gon e . From u p above I
hear the Rap of wings.
You 're totally confused.

Not long afterward , the two soldiers appear.
They're weari ng battle fatigues of the old Imperial army. S h ort-sleeved
summer uniforms , gaiters , and knapsacks . No h elmets , j ust caps with b ills ,
and some kind of black face paint. Both of them are young. O n e of them's
tall and th i n , with round, metal-framed glasses. The other o n e 's sh ort, broad­
shouldere d , and musc ular. They're both sitting o n a Rat rock, n ei ther one
looking like h e 's about to leap into battle . Their Arisaka riRes are o n th e
ground by their feet. The tall soldier seems bored and is chewing on a stem of
grass. The two of th em look completely natural, like they belong h ere .
Unperturbed, they watch as I approach .
There's a small Rat clearing around them, like a landing on a sta ircase.
" Hey, " the tall soldier calls out cheerfully.
" H ow ya doing? " the brawny one says with the smallest of frown s .
" H ow a r e you ? " I greet th em back. I know I should be amazed t o s e e
them, but someh ow it doesn't seem weird at all. I t's entirely with i n t h e realm
of possib ility.
"We were wa iting for you , " the tall one says .
" For me? " I ask.
" S ur e , " h e replies. "No one else is comi ng out here, that's for s ur e . "
"We 've been wa iting a long time , " the brawny one says .

373

"Not that time 's mu ch of a factor here , " the tall one adds. " S t i l l , you took
l onger than I figured."
"Yo u 're the two guys who disappeared in th is forest a long, long time ago ,
right? " I ask. " During ma neuvers? "
The brawny soldier nods. "That's us."
"They searched everywhere for you , " I say.
"Yeah , I know, " he says. "I know they were looking for us. I know every­
th ing that goes on in this forest. But they're not about to find us, no matter
h ow hard they look."
"Actually, we didn't get lost, " the tall one says. "We ran away."
"Not running away so much as j ust stumbling onto th is spot and deciding
to stay put, " the brawny one adds. "That's different from getting lost."
"Not j ust anybody can find th is place, " the tall soldier says. " B u t we did,
and now you have too. It was a stroke of luck - for us, at l east."
"If we hadn't found th is spot, they would 've s h i pped us overseas , " the
brawny one expl a i ns. " Over there it was kill or be killed. That wasn't for us.
I 'm a farmer, original ly, and my buddy here j ust graduated from college.
Neither one of us wants to kill anybody. And being killed 's even worse. Kind
of obvious, I 'd say."
" How 'bout you ? " the tall one asks me. "Would you l ike to kill anybody,
or be killed? "
I shake my head. No, neither one, definitely not.
"Everybody feels l ike that, " the tall one says. "Or the vast ma j ority, at
least. But if you say, H ey, I don't want to go off to war, th e country's not about
to break out i n smiles and give you permission to skip out.You can't ru n away.
Japan's a small country, so where are you going to run to? They'll track you
down so fast it'll make your head spin. That's why we stayed here. Th is i s the
only place we could h ide." He shakes his head and goes

0 11 .

"And we 've

stayed h ere ever s i nce. Like you said, from a long, long time ago. Not that
time 's a ma j or factor h ere. There's almost no differe n c e at all betwee n n ow
and a long, long time ago."
"No difference at a l l , " the brawny one says , wavi ng someth ing away with
h i s hand.
"You knew I was coming? " I ask.
" Sure th ing, " the brawny one repli es.
"We 've been standing guard here for a long time , so we know if some­
body's coming, " the other one said. "We 're l ike part of the forest."
"Th is is the entrance , " the brawny one says. "And we 're guardi ng i t."

3 74

"And right now the entrance happens to be open, " the tall one expla i ns .
"B efore long, th ough, it'll close up. I f you want to c ome i n , now's the time .
It doesn't open up all that often . "
"We 'll lead the way, " the brawny one says . "The path 's hard to follow, so
you need someone to guide you i n . "
"If you don't come i n , the n go back where you came from, " the tall o n e
says . "It's not all t h a t hard t o find y o u r way back, so don't worry a b o u t i t .
You 'll do fi n e . Then you 'll return to the world you came from, to the life
you 've been livi ng. The choice is entirely up to you . Nobody's going to
force you to do one or the other. But once you 're i n , it isn't easy to turn back. "
"Take me inside, " I answer without a moment's hesitati o n .
"Are y o u sure ? " t h e brawny o n e asks .
"Somebody's inside I have to see, " I say. "At least I th ink so . . . . "
Slowly, silently, the two of them get up off the rock a n d shoulder their
rifles. They exchange a glance and walk on ahead of me .
"You must th ink it's strange we still lug around these h eavy lumps of
steel , " the tall o n e says, turning around. "Th ey're worthless. Never had any
bullets anyway. "
" B u t they're a kind of sign," the brawny one says , not looking back at me .
"A sign of what we left beh i n d . "
"Symbols are important, " the tall one adds. "We happen to have these
rifles and soldiers' uniforms , so we play th e part of sentri es. That's our rol e .
Symbols gu ide u s to t h e roles we play. "
"Do you h ave anyth ing like that with you ? " the brawny o n e asks . "Someth ing that can be a sign? "
I shake my head. "No, I don't have anyth ing. Just memories . "
"Hmm . . . , " the brawny one says . "Memories, h u h ? "
"That's okay. Doesn't matter, " the tall one says . "Memories can be a great
symbol too . C o ur s e I don't have any idea how well memories will stand up,
h ow long they'll last. "
"Someth i n g that has a form or a shape is best, if you can manage it, " the
brawny one says . "It's easier to understand . "
"Like a r i fl e , " the tall one says . "By the way, what's your name ? "
"Kafka Tamura , " I answer.
"Kafka Tamura , " they both repeat.
"Weird name , " the tall one says .
"You got that right, " the brawny one adds.
After th i s we walk i n silence down the path .

Chapter 44

T

hey took the three files to a riverbed along the h i ghway and burned
them. Hoshino had bought lighter fluid at a convenience store , and
doused the files before setting them ablaze. Then h e and Nakata

stood by silently as they watched each page become engulfed i n flames.
There was barely a h i n t of wind, and th e smoke rose stra ight up, getti ng lost
among the low-hanging gray clouds.
" S o we can't read any of these papers? " Hosh ino asked.
"No, we 're not supposed to, " Nakata replied. "I promised M iss Saeki we
wouldn't, and my j ob is to keep that promise."
"Yeah, keep ing promises is important, " Hosh ino said, wiping away sweat
from his forehead. "It would be nice if we had a shredder, th ough. That
would sure make i t a lot easier. Copy shops have big shredders you can
rent pretty ch eap. Don't get me wrong, I 'm not compla i n i ng. It's j ust kind
of hot to make a bonfire at th is time of year. If it were winter, that'd be
another story."
''I 'm sorry, but I promised M iss Saeki I 'd burn it all up. So that's what
Nakata has to do."
" Okay, th en. I 'm in no rush.A li ttle heat's not going to k ill me. It was j ust
a , what do you call it - a suggestion."
A cat saunteri ng along stopped to watc h , a ski nny, brown-striped cat
whose tail was slightly bent at the tip. A personable cat, by the looks of
it. Nakata badly wanted to talk with it but decided h e 'd better not, s i n c e
Hoshino w a s with him. T h e c a t wouldn't be able to relax u nless they were
alo n e . Besides, Nakata wasn't at all confident h e could speak with cats like he
used to. The last th ing he wanted was to blurt out someth ing weird and
frighten the poor animal. Before long, the cat grew bored of watc h i n g th e
bon fire , stood up, and padded away.
A long while later, after the files were completely burned, Hosh i n o
stomped t h e a s h e s into dust. T h e next strong w i n d would scatter all th e

remains. The sun was n early setti ng by th en, and crows were flying back to
their nests.
" Nobody's gonna read it now, " Hoshino said. "I don't know what was
written in it, but it's all gone. A bit of shape and form has disappeared from
the worl d , increas ing the amount of noth ingness."
" Mr. Hoshino? "
"What's u p ? "
"I have a question I 'd l ike to ask."
" Fire away."
"Can noth i ngness i ncrease? "
Hoshino puzzled th is one over for a wh ile. "That's a tough o n e , " h e
admitted. " I f someth ing returns t o noth i ng i t becomes z ero , but even if you
add zero to zero, i t's still zero."
"I don't u n d erstand."
" I don't get i t either. Th inking about those kinds of th i n gs always gives
me a headache."
"So maybe we should stop th inking about it."
"Fine with me , " Hoshino said. "Anyhow, the ma nuscri pt's all burned up.
All the words i n it have disappeared. It's gone back to noth i ng - that's what
I wanted to say. "
"That's a l oad off m y mi nd."
"So th is pretty mu ch wraps up what we need to do h ere , right? "
Hoshino asked.
"Yes, we've almost finished what we need to do, " Nakata said. "All that's
left is to close u p the entran ce again."
"That's pretty importa nt, h u h ? "
" I t is. What's opened has to be sh ut."
"We l l , let's get to it. Strike wh ile the iron is hot and all that. "
"Mr. Hoshino? "
"Yeah ? "
"We can't do it n ow."
"Why not? "
" I t's not time yet, " Nakata said. "We have to wa it for th e right time to shut
the entrance. Before that, I have to get some sleep. Nakata 's so sleepy."
Hoshino looked at the old man. "Wait a sec - you 're not going to sack out
for days on end aga i n , are you ? "
"I can't say, but it may turn out like that."
" C a n ' t we take care of busi ness before you zonk out? Look - once you
shift into sleep mode th i ngs kind of come to a halt."

377

" Mr. Hoshino? "
"What's up? "
" I wish we could shut the entrance first. That would be wonderfu l . But I
have to get some sleep first. I can't keep my eyes open anymore . "
"Like your batteries have fizzled out or someth ing? "
" I suppose. It took l onger than I thought to do what we needed to d o .
Al l m y en ergy's gon e . Would you take me b a c k t o wh ere Nakata can get
some sleep? "
" N o problem. We 'll grab a cab and head back to the apartment. Th e n
you can sleep l ike a l o g if you want. "

Once they'd settled i nto the cab Nakata started to nod out.
"You can sleep as much as you wa nt once we 're back i n the apartme nt, "
Hoshino said. " B u t hang in there until we get home , okay? "
" Mr. Hosh ino? "
"Yup? "
" I 'm sorry to have put you to so much trouble , " Nakata murmured
vaguely.
"Yeah, I guess you have , " Hoshino admitte d . " B u t nobody asked me to
come - I tagged along of my own free wil l . Like vol u nteeri ng to shovel snow.
So don't worry about it. "
" I f you hadn't helped me , Nakata wouldn't have kn own what to d o .
I wouldn't have fi n i s h e d even h a l f o f what I h a d t o d o . "
"We l l , if you put it that way, I guess it was worth the effort. "
" I 'm very grateful to you . "
"But you know what? " Hoshino sa id.
"What? "
" I have a lot to thank you for too, Mr. Nakata . "
" I s that right? "
" It's been about ten days since all th is began , " H osh i n o said. " I 've skipped
out on work the whole time . The first couple of days I got i n touch with them
and asked for some time off, but right now I'm sort of AWOL. I probably
won't get my oid j ob back. Maybe, if I get down on my knees and apologize,
they might forgive me . But it's no big deal . Not to brag or anyth ing, but fi n d­
ing another j ob won't be hard - I 'm a great driver and a good worker. So I 'm
not worried about that, and neither should you b e . What I 'm trying to say is
that I don't have any regrets about being with you . These past ten days there 's
been a lot of bizarre stuff going on. Leeches fal l i n g from the sky, Colonel

Sanders popp ing up out of th i n air, hot sex with this drop-dead-gorgeous p h i­
losophy ma j or, swiping the entrance stone from that shrine . . . . A lifetime of
weird stuff packed into ten days . Like we've been doing test ru ns o n a roller
coaster or someth i ng. "
Hoshino stopped h ere , th inking how to go o n . " B u t you know what,
Cramps ? "
"Yes? "
"The most amazing th ing of all has been you, Mr. Nakata. You changed
my life . Th ese past ten days , I don't know - th i ngs look different to me n ow.
Stuff I never would 've given a second glance before seems different. Like
mus i c , for instance - music I used to th ink was boring really gets to me n ow.
I feel like I 've gotta tell somebody about th is or bust, somebody who 'll u n d er­
stand what I 've gone through . Noth ing like th is ever happened to me before .
And it's all because of you . I 've started to see the world through your eyes. Not

everything, mi n d you . I like h ow you look at life , so that's why i t happe n e d .
That's w h y I 've stayed with y o u through t h i c k and th i n , w h y I couldn't leave
you . I t's been one of the most meaningful times I 've ever had in my life .
So there's no need for you t o b e thanking m e - n o t that I mi n d i t . I should
be thanking you . All I 'm trying to say is you 've done me a lot of good,
Mr. Nakata. Do you know what I 'm saying? "
B u t Nakata wasn't listening anymore . H i s eyes were shut, h i s breath i n g
regular as he slept.
"What a happy-go-lucky guy, " Hoshino said, and sighed .

Hosh i n o carri ed the old man in h i s arms up to the apartme nt and put h i m to
bed. He took off Nakata's shoes but left his clothes on, and c overed h i m with
a light comforter. Nakata squ irmed a bit, the n settled down as usual, on h i s
back facing the ceiling. H i s breath ing was quiet and he was still.
Bet we're i n for another three-day sleep marathon, Hoshino thought to
h i mself.
B u t that's not h ow th i ngs turned out. Before noon the n ext day, Wednes­
day, Mr. Nakata was dead. He died peacefully in h i s sleep. H i s fac e was as
calm as always , and h e looked like h e was j ust sleep i n g - only not breath ing.
Hosh ino shook the old man 's shoulders and called out h i s name , but there
was n o mistaking it - h e was dead . Hoshino checked his pulse - noth i ng­
and even put a hand mirror n ear h i s mouth , but it didn't cloud u p . H e 'd
stopped breath ing c ompletely. In th is world , at least, he was never going to
wake up aga i n .

Alone in the room with the corpse , Hosh ino noticed h ow, very gradually,
all sounds disappeared. H ow the real sounds around h i m steadily lost their
reality. Meaningful sounds all ended up as silence. And the silence grew,
deeper and deeper, like silt on the bottom of the sea. It accumulated at h i s
feet, reached up t o h i s waist, then up t o h i s chest. H e watched as t h e layers o f
silence rose up h igher a n d h igher. He s a t down on t h e sofa and gazed at
Nakata's fac e , trying to accept the fact that he was really gone. It took him a
long time to accept it.As he sat there the air began to feel strangely heavy and
h e could no longer tell if his thoughts and feelings were really h is. B u t there
were a few th i ngs h e started to understand.
Maybe death would take Nakata back to the way h e used to be. Wh en he
was alive, h e was always good old Nakata, a not-so-bright, cat-talking old
man. Maybe death was the only road back to being th e "normal Nakata " h e 'd
always talked about.
"H ey, Cramps , " Hoshino said. "Maybe I should n ' t say th is, but if you
gotta die, th is isn't such a bad way to go."
Nakata had passed away calmly i n his sleep, most likely not th inking of
anyth ing. His face was peaceful, with no signs of suffering, regret, or confu­
sion. Ve ry Nakata-like , Hosh ino concluded. But what his life had really
meant, Hoshino had no idea. Not that anybody's life had more clear-c u t
m e a n i n g to it. What's really important for people , w h a t really has dignity, i s

how they d i e .Compared t o that, he thought, how y o u lived d o e s n ' t amount to
much. Still, h ow you live determines how you die. These though ts ran
through his head as he stared at the face of the dead old man.
But one criti cal th ing remai ned. Someone had to close up the entra nce

stone . Nakata had finished everyth ing h e 'd set out to do except that. The
stone was right th ere, at Hosh ino's feet, and h e knew that when the time
came h e had to roll it over and shut up the entrance. But Nakata had warned
him that if you mishandled it, the stone could be very dange rous. There had
to be a right way of turning the stone ove r - but also a wrong way. I f you j ust
powered it over, that could sc rew up the entire world.
"I can't do anything about your having died, Cramps, but you've left m e
i n a real bind here, " Hoshino s a i d , addressing t h e corpse, wh ich of course
didn't respond.
There was also the question of what to do with the body. The normal
response would be to ring up the police or th e hospital and have them take it.
N i n ety-nine percent of the people in the world would have done exactly that,
and Hosh ino wanted to. But the pol ice were h u nting for Nakata i n connec­
tion with that murder case, and getting i n touch with the authorities at th i s

point woul d defi nitely put Hoshino in a precarious position. The police
would haul h i m off and gri l l him for hours. Explaining everyth ing that had
happened was the last th ing h e wanted to do, plus there was the fact that h e
w a s no fan of l aw enforcement. If h e c o u l d avoid having anyth ing to do with
cops, so muc h the better.
And h ow th e hell do I explain th is apartme nt? he wondere d .
A n old m a n dressed u p l ike Colonel Sanders lent us t h e p l a c e . S a i d h e 'd
prepared it specially for us and that we could use it as long as we l iked . Would
the pol ice really buy that? Colonel Sanders? Is he with the U. S. army? No, you

know - the Kentucky Fried Chicken guy. You must've seen their billboards,
right, detective? Yeah, that's the guy - g lasses, wh ite goa tee . . . . He was a pimp
working the back alleys of Takamatsu. He got a girl for me. Expla i n stuff l ike
that and the cops would call h im an idiot and give him a swift p u n c h to
the head. Cops, Hoshino concluded, not for the first time in h i s l i fe , are j ust
gangsters who get paid by the state.
He let out a deep sigh.
What I 've got to do, he thought, is get out of h ere right n ow, as far away as
I can. I can make an anonymous call to the cops from a pay phone at th e sta­
tion. G ive them the address h ere , say that somebody's died . Then hop a tra i n
back t o Nagoya. They'll never connect m e t o t h e case. T h e old m a n d i e d a
natural death , so the cops won't launch some i nvestigati on. They'll hand over
the body to h is relatives and there 'll be a simple fu nera l , end of story. Then
I'll go to my company, bow and scrape i n front of the president: It 'll never

happen aga in, I swear. I 'll work hard from now on. Whatever i t takes to get my
old job back.
He started packing, crammi ng a cha nge of cl oth es in h i s bag. He put o n
h i s C h u n i c h i Dragons c a p , p u l l i ng h i s ponytail through th e opening i n back,
and his dark green sunglasses. Th irsty, he got a Diet Pepsi from th e refrigera­
tor. As he leaned back against the fridge and drank, h e noticed the round
stone next to th e sofa. H e went i nto the bedroom and looked at Nakata 's
corpse one more time. He sti l l didn't look l ike he was dead. H e looked l ike h e
was qu ietly breath ing, a n d Hoshino h a l f expected h im t o suddenly s i t u p a n d
say, Mr. Hoshino, it's a ll a m istake. Nakata 's not really dead! B u t h e didn't.
Nakata was most definitely deceased. There weren't going to be any miracles.
The old man had already crossed the great divid e .
Pepsi i n hand, Hoshino stood there , shaking h i s h e a d . I can't j u st go off
and l eave the stone b e h i n d , h e thought. If I did, Mr. Nakata won't be able to
truly rest i n peace. H e was such a conscientious type , always making sure
th i ngs were done just right. And h e would 've finished th is final task, i f his

batteries hadn't run out. Hoshino crushed the empty aluminum can and
tossed it i n the trash. Still th irsty, he went back into the kitchen and popped
open another Peps i .
Mr. Nakata told m e how h e wanted, i f only o n e time, t o b e able t o read ,
Hoshino remembere d . He said he wanted to go to a l i b rary and be able to
choose any book and read it. But he died before he could make that dream
come tru e . Maybe now that he's dead he's gone on to another worl d , where
h e 's become a normal Nakata, and can read . As long as h e was in this worl d ,
though, he never could. In fact, his fi n a l a c t on earth w a s qu i te th e oppo­
site - burning up writi ng. Sending all those words on the pages off into the
voi d . Kind of ironi c , when you th ink about it. That being the case , though ,
Hoshino thought, I need to ful fi l l his final wish . I 've got to close the entrance.
I wasn't able to take him to the movies, or the aquari u m - so it's the l east I
can do for h i m , n ow that he's gone.
H e drained h i s second can of Pepsi, went over to the sofa , crouched
down , and tried l ifting the stone. It wasn't so heavy. Not exactly l ight, either,
but it didn't take all that much to l i ft it up. About as heavy as when h e and
Colonel Sanders had stolen it from the shri n e . About as heavy as the kind of
stones used to weigh down pickles as they ferment. That means right now it's
j ust a stone, Hosh ino thought. Wh en the stone's acting as an entra n c e , it's so
h eavy you have to k i l l yourself to pick it up. But when it's l ight l ike th i s , i t's
j ust an ordinary stone . Someth ing extraordinary has to happen fi rst, for the
stone to become as h eavy as it did and change i nto the e ntrance sto n e . Like
l i ghtning striking all over town or someth ing . . .
Hosh i n o went to the window, opened the curta i n , and gazed u p at the
sky from the veranda. The sky was the same as th e day before, a mass of drab
gray clouds. But it didn't look l ike it was goi ng to ra i n , much l ess th under.
He perked up h i s ears and sniffed the air, but eve ryth ing seemed the same as
yesterday. Steady as she goes seemed to be today's th eme for the worl d .
" H ey, C ramps," he s a i d aloud t o the dead m a n . " Cuess I j ust have t o wa i t
here with you for someth ing o u t o f the ordi nary t o happe n . What t h e heck
that could be, I have no idea. Or even when it might take place. Plus it's Jun e ,
a n d your body's gonna decay and start to stink pretty soon . I know you don't
want to hear th i s , but that's nature for you . And the more time that passes, a n d
t h e later I g e t i n touch with t h e cops, t h e worse it'll g e t for m e . I mean, I 'll do
whatever I can, but I j ust wanted you to know the situatio n , okay?"
There was no reply, of course.
Hosh i n o wandered around the ro0111 . That's it! Colonel Sanders might
get i n touch ! He 'd know what to do with the stone. H i m you could always

count on for some warmhearted , practical advi c e . But no matter how long h e
stared at t h e phone, it just s a t there , a s i l e nt, unnecessarily i n trospective
object. Nobody knocked on the door, not a s i ngle l e tter arrive d . And noth i ng
out of the ordi nary happened . The weather stayed the sa m e , and no flashes of
inspiration struck h i m . One express ionless moment after another ticked by.
Noon came and went, the afternoon qu ietly ree l i n g into twil ight. The hands
of the e lectric c l ock on the wal l skimmed smoothly ove r the surface of time
l ike a whirligig beetl e , and on the bed Mr. Nakata was sti l l dead. Hoshino
didn't fee l h u ngry at a l l . He had a th i rd can of Pepsi and dutifu l l y munched
on some crackers .
At six p . m . he sat down on the sofa , pi cked up the remote, and switched
on the TV. H e watched the NHK evening news , but noth i ng caught h i s atten­
tion. I t had been an ordi nary day, a slow news day. The a n n o u n cer's voi c e
started to grate o n h i s nerves, and w h e n t h e program w a s over h e turned off
the TV. It was getting darker outside, and finally night took over. An even
greater stillness and quiet enveloped the room.
" H ey, Cramps," Hoshino said to Nakata . "Could you get u p , j ust for a
few m i nutes? I don't know what th e hell to d o . And I miss your voi c e . "
Naturally Nakata d i d n ' t reply. He was stil l on t h e other s i d e of t h e divi d e .
Wordlessly h e continued as h e was , d e a d . T h e s i l ence grew deeper, so deep
that if you l i stened carefully you might very well catch the sound of the earth
revolving on i ts axi s .
H osh i n o w e n t out t o t h e l iving room a n d put on t h e Archdu ke Tri o . A s he
l istened to the fi rst th eme, tears came to h i s eyes, th en the fl o odgates opened.
Jeez, he thought, when was the last time I cried? H e couldn't remember.

Chapter 45

A

s advertised, the path from the "entrance" on is hard to fol l ow. Actu­
ally, it's pretty much given up on trying to be a path . The farther we
go, the deeper and more enormous the forest gets . The slope gets a

whole lot steeper, the ground more overgrown with bushes and undergrowth .
The sky has j ust about disappeared, and it's so dim that it seems l ike twi l ight.
Th ick spiderwebs loom up all over the place, and the a i r's th ick with the
smell of plants . The sil ence gets even deeper, l ike the forest is trying to re j ect
th is i nvas ion of its territory by h u man beings . The soldiers, rifles slung across
their backs , seem oblivious as they easily cut through openi ngs i n the th ick
fol iage . They're amazi ngly fast as they slip past the l ow-hanging branches,
clamber up rocks , l eap over hollows, neatly avoiding a l l the th orns.
I scramble to keep up and not lose sight of them as they forge o n ahead.
They never check to see if I'm sti l l there. It's l ike they're testi ng m e , to see
h ow much I can handle. I don't know why, but it a l most feels l ike they're
angry with me. They don't say a word , not j ust to me but to each other.
They're totally focused on walking. Without a word between th e m , they take
turns i n the lead. The black barrels of the rifles on th eir backs swing back and
forth i n front of me, as regular as a metronome . The whole th ing starts to get
hypnotic after a wh i l e . My mind starts to wander, l ike i t's slipping o n ice, to
somewhere else. But I still have to focus on keeping u p with their relentl ess
pace, so I march on, th e sweat pouring off me now.
"We goi ng too fast for you ? " the brawny soldier finally turns around and
asks. H e 's not out of breath at all .
" N o , I ' m fi n e ," I tel l h i m . 'Tm hanging in there."
"You 're young, and l ook l ike you 're i n good shape," the tall one com­
ments without looking around.
"We know th is path real wel l , so sometimes we speed up too much ," th e
brawny one expl a i n s . " S o tell me if we 're goi ng too fast. Don't be shy, okay?

Just say the word and we 'll slow down . But understand we don't want to go
any slower than we have to. You know what I ' m sayi ng?"
"I'll let you know i f I can't keep up," I tel l him, forcing myself not to
breath e too hard , so they won 't have any idea how tired th is i s making m e .
"Do w e have far t o go?"
" N o , not really," th e tall one answers .
"We 're almost there," the other one adds.
I ' m not sure I really bel ieve h i m . Like they sa i d , ti me's not much of a fac­
tor here.
So we walk on for a wh ile without talking, at a less bl istering pace than
before . I t seems l ike th ey've finished testi ng m e .
"Are there any poisonous snakes in th is forest? " I a s k , s i n c e it's b e e n
worrymg m e .
" Poisonous snakes, e h ? " t h e t a l l one with t h e glasses says without turn i n g
around. H e n e v e r turns around w h e n he talks, always facing forward l ike
someth ing absolutely critical 's about to leap out i n front of us at any moment.
" I never thought about it."
" C o u l d b e ," the brawny one says , tu rning to l ook at m e . " I haven't seen
any, but there m i gh t be som e . Not that it matters even if there are."
"What we 're trying to say," the tall one adds casual ly, " i s that the forest
isn't out to harm you . "
" S o y o u d o n ' t n e e d t o worry about snakes or anyth i ng," t h e b rawny o n e
says . " Feel better now?"
"Yes," I reply.
" N o other h ere - poisonous snakes or mushrooms, venomous spiders or
insects - is goi ng to do you any harm," the tall soldier says , as always without
turning arou n d .

"Other? " I ask. I can't g e t a mental picture of what h e m e a n s . I must
be tired .
"An other, no other th i ng," he says . "No th i ng's goi ng to harm you
here. We 're in th e deepest part of the forest, after all . And n o one - not even
yourself- is goi ng to h u rt you . "
I try t o figure out w h a t h e means . But w h a t with t h e exhausti o n , sweat,
and hypnotic effect of th is repetitive j ourney through the woods, my bra i n
can't form a coherent thought.
"When we were soldiers they used to force us to practi ce ripping open
the enemy's stomach with a bayonet," th e brawny one says . "You know th e
best way to stab someone with a bayonet?"

" N o ," I reply.
"We l l , fi rst you stab your bayonet deep i nto his bel ly, then you twist it
sideways . That rips the guts to ribbons. Then the guy dies a horribl e , slow,
painfu l death . B u t if you j ust stab without twisting, then your enemy can
j u m p up and rip your guts to shreds. That's the kind of world we were i n ."
Guts . Osh ima told me once that intesti nes are a metaphor for a
labyri nth . My head's ful l of all kinds of thoughts , all intertwined and tangl e d .
I c a n ' t t e l l t h e difference between o n e t h i n g a n d another.
"Do you know why people have to do such cruel thi ngs l ike that to oth e r
people ? " t h e tall s o l d i e r asks.
"I have no idea," I reply.
" Neither do I ," he says . "I don't care who the enemy is - C h i nese sol­
diers, Russ ians, Americans. I never wanted to rip open their guts. But that's
the kind of world we l ived in, and that's why we ran away. Don't get me
wrong, the two of us weren't cowards . We were actually pretty good soldiers.
We j ust couldn't put up with that rush to viol ence. I don't imagine you 're a
coward , either."
" I really don't know," 1 answer honestly. "But I 've always tried to get
stronger."
"That's very i mportant," the brawny one says, turning i n my direction
aga i n . "Very i mportant - to do your best to get stronger."
"I can tell you 're pretty strong," the tall one says . " Most kids you r age
wouldn't make i t th is fa r."
"Yeah, it is pretty impressive," the brawny one pipes i n .
T h e two o f th e m come t o a halt a t th is point. T h e t a l l soldier takes off h i s
glasses, rubs t h e s i d e s of his nose a couple of times, t h e n puts h i s glasses on
aga i n . Neither one's out of breath or has even worked up a sweat.
"Th i rsty?" the tall one asks me.
"A l i ttle ," I reply. Actually, my canteen gone along with my daypack, I'm
dying of th i rst. H e unhooks the canteen from h i s waist and hands i t to me.
I take a few gulps of the l ukewarm water. The l i qu i d quenches eve ry pore of
my body. I wipe the mouth of the canteen off and hand it back. "Thanks," I
say. The tall soldier nods silently.
"We 've reached the ridge," the brawny soldier says .
"We 're goi ng to go stra ight to the bottom without stopp ing, so watch you r
footing," t h e t a l l one says .
1 fol l ow them carefully down the tricky, s l ippery slope. We get about

halfway down , th en turn a corner and cut through some trees, and all of a
sudden a world opens up below us. Th e two soldiers stop, and turn around to

look at m e . They don't say a th i ng, but th eir eyes speak vol u m e s . Th is is the

place, they're tel l i n g me. The place you 're going to enter. I stand there with
them and gaze out at that worl d .
Th e whole p l a c e is a basi n neatly carved o u t of t h e natural conto u rs o f
t h e l a n d . H ow m a n y people might be l iving there I have n o i d e a , but there
can't be many - th e place isn't big enough . There 're a couple of roads, with
b u i ldi ngs here and th ere along either side. Small roads, and equally small
b u ildings. Nobody's out on the roads. The b u i ldings are a l l express ionless,
built l ess for beauty th an to withstand the eleme nts . The place i s too small
to be called a town . Th ere aren't any shops as far as I can tel l . No signs
or bulletin boards. I t's l ike a bunch of buildings, all the same s i z e a n d shape,
j ust happened to come togeth er to make up a l i ttle community. None of
the b u i l di ngs h ave gardens, and not a si ngle tree l i n e s the road s . Like with the
forest all aro u n d there's no need for any extra plants or trees.
A fa i n t breeze is cutting through the woods, making the l eaves of the
trees around m e tremble. That anonymous rustl ing forms ripples o n the folds
of my m i n d . I rest a hand aga i nst a tree trunk and close my eye s . Those ripples
seem to be a sign, a signal of some sort, but it's l ike a foreign l anguage I can't
decipher. I give u p , open my eyes, and gaze out aga i n at th i s brand-new world
before m e . Standing th ere halfway down the slope , staring down at th is place
with two soldi e rs , I feel those ripples sh ifting inside m e . These signs recon­
figure themselves, the metaphors transform , and I ' m drifting away, away from
myself. I ' m a butterfly, fl i tting along the edges of creati o n . Beyond the edge of
the world there's a space where emptiness and substance neatly overlap,
where past and future form a continuous, endless loop. And hovering about
the re are s igns n o one has eve r read , chords n o one has eve r heard .
I try to calm my ragged breath ing. My heart still isn't back i n one p i e c e ,
but at l e a s t I ' m not afra i d .
Without a word t h e soldiers start walking aga i n , a n d s i l e ntly I fol l ow
along. As we go farthe r down the slope, the town draws closer. I see a small
stream running alongs ide a road, with a stone wal l as an embankment. The
beautiful clear water gurgl es pleasantly. Eve ryth ing here i s s i m p l e , and cozy.
Slim poles with wires strung between them dot the area, wh i c h means they
must have electricity. E l ectricity? Out here?
The place i s surrounded by a high, green ridge . The sky's sti l l a mass of
gray clouds. The soldiers and I walk down the road but don't pass a s i ngle per­
son . Everyth ing's completely sti l l , not a sound to be heard . Maybe they're all
shut up inside their homes, holding their breath , wa iting for us to go.
My companions take me to one of the dwell i ngs . S trange th ing i s , i t's the

same size and shape as Oshima's cab i n . Like one was the model for the other.
There's a porch out front, and a chair. The building has a flat roof with a
stovepipe sticking out the top . There 's a plain si ngle bed i n the bedroom, all
neatly made up. The only differences are that the bedroom and l iving room
are separate from each other, and there's a toilet inside and the place has elec­
tricity. There's even a fridge in the kitchen, a smal l , old-fashioned mode l .
A l ight hangs down from th e ceiling. And there 's a TV. A TV?
" For the time being, you 're supposed to stay here till you get settl ed," the
brawny soldier says . "It won't be for that long. For the time being ."
"Like I said before, time isn't much of a factor here," the tall one says .
The other one nods in agreement. " Not a factor at all."
"Where could the electricity be coming from ? "
They l o o k at e a c h other.
"There 's a small wind-power station farther on i n the forest," the tall o n e
expl a i n s . "The wind's always blowing there . Gatta have electric i ty, right?"
"No electricity and you can't use th e fridge," the brawny one says .
" N o fri dge and you can't keep food for long."
"You'd manage somehow without it," th e tall one says. "Though it sure is
a nice th ing to have ."
" I f you get hungry," the brawny one adds, "help yourself to whatever's i n
t h e fridge. There i s n ' t much , I'm afra id."
"There's no meat here, no fish, coffee, or l i quor," the tall one says .
" I t's hard at fi rst, but you ' l l get used to it."
"But you do have eggs and cheese and mi lk," the brawny soldier says .
" Gatta have you r prote i n , right?"
"They don't make those other th ings here," the tall one expl a i n s , "so you
have to go somewhere else to get the m . And swap someth ing for th e m . "
" S omewhere else?"
T h e t a l l one n o d s . "That's right. We 're not cut off from t h e world h e r e .
There is a somewhere else. It might take a wh i l e , but you 'll understan d . "
" S omeone will be a l o n g i n t h e evening t o make dinner for you ," t h e
brawny soldier says . "If y o u g e t bored before the n , y o u can watc h TV."
"They have shows on the TV? "
"We l l , I don't know what's on," th e tall one repl ies, a b i t fl ustere d . He tilts
h i s head and l ooks at h i s companion.
H i s brawny friend tilts his head too, a doubtful look on h i s fa c e . "To be
honest with you , I don't know much about TV. I 've never watched it."
"They put the TV there for people who've j ust come here ," the tall
one says .

" B u t you should be able to watch something, " the brawny one says .
"Just rest up for a wh i l e ," the tall one says . "We have to get back to
our post."
"Thanks for bringing me here."
"No probl e m ," the brawny one says . "You have much stronger l egs than
the others we 've brought here . Lots of people can't keep u p . S o m e we even
have to carry on our backs . So you were one of the easy ones."
"If memory serves," the tall soldier says , "you said th ere's somebody you
want to see here."
"That's right."
'Tm sure you ' l l meet whoever that is before long," h e says , nodding a
couple of times for emphasis. " I t's a small world here."
" I hope you get used to it soon," the brawny soldier says .
"Once you get used to it, the rest is easy," the tall soldier adds.
" I really appreciate it."
The two of th em stand at attention and salute, th en shoulder their rifles
and l eave , walking qui ckly down the road back toward their post. They must
guard the entrance there day and night.

I go to the kitchen and check out what's i n the fridge . There are some toma­
toes, a chunk of cheese, eggs , carrots , turnips eve n , and a l arge porc e l a i n j ug
of milk. Butter, too . A loaf of bread's on a shelf, and I tear off a p i e c e and taste
it. A l i ttle hard , but not bad.
The kitchen has a s i nk and a faucet. I turn the faucet and water comes
out, clear and c o l d . S i n c e they have electricity, they must p u m p water up
from a wel l . I fill up a cup and drink it.
I go over to the window and look outside. The sky's sti l l covered with gray
clouds, though it doesn't look l ike it's going to ra i n anyti me soon. I stare out
the window a l o ng time but sti l l don't see any sign of other peopl e . I t's l ike the
town 's dead . Or else for some reason everybody's trying to avoid m e .
I walk away from t h e wi ndow a n d sit down i n a hard, stra ight-backed
wooden chair. There 're three chairs altogeth er, and a square dining table
that's been varnished a number of ti mes. Noth ing at a l l 's hanging on the pIas­
ter walls, no paintings, no ph otos, not even a calendar. Just pure white wal l s .
A s i ngle b u l b dangles from t h e ceiling, with a simple glass shade that's dis­
colored by heat.
The room has been nicely cleaned. I ru n my finger ove r the tabl etop and
the wi ndow frame and there's no dust at a l l . The windows, too, are sparkl ing

clean . The pots, plates, and various utensils in the kitchen aren't n ew, but it's
clear they've been well cared for and are all clean. Next to the work space i n
t h e kitchen are two o l d electric h o t plates . I switch one of them o n , a n d right
away the coil turns red .
Th ere's an old color TV in a heavy wooden cabinet that I ' m guessing is
fifteen or twenty years old. There's no remote contro l . I t l ooks l ike someth i n g
that w a s th rown away and then retrieved. Wh ich could be s a i d of all the
electric items, all of wh ich look l ike they were saved from the trash . Not that
they were di rty or anyth ing, or didn't work, j us t that they're all faded and out
of date .
I turn on the switch on th e T V, and an old movie 's playing, The Sound of

Music. My teacher took us all to see it on a widescreen movie theater when I
was in grade schoo l . No adults were around to take me to the theater, so i t's
one of the few movies I saw when I was a kid. On TV they're at the part where
the diffi c u l t, uptight father, Capta in von Trapp, has gone to Vienna on busi­
ness, and Maria, the c h i ldren's tutor, takes them on an outing i n the moun­
tains. They all sit togeth er on the grass and she plays guitar and they sing a
couple of harmless songs . It's a fa mous scene. I plant myself i n front of the
T V, glued to the movie. Just l ike when I fi rst saw it, I wonder h ow thi n gs
wou l d 've turned out if I 'd had someone l ike Maria with m e . Needless to say,
n obody l ike that ever showed up in my l i fe .
I fl a s h b a c k t o real ity. Why in t h e world do I have to watch The Sound of

Music right now? Why that movie? Maybe the people here have hooked u p
some sort of sate l l ite d i s h a n d c a n g e t t h e signal from a stati o n . Or is it a video­
tape being played somewhere and shown on this set? I 'd guess it's a tape ,
because when I change channels the other ones show only sandstorm s .
A vicious sandstorm 's exactly what it reminds me of, t h e gravelly white, inor­
ganic stati c .
They're si nging " E delweiss" when I turn off the set. Quiet returns t o the
roo m . I'm thi rsty, so I go to the kitchen and drink some milk fro m the j u g .
T h e m i lk's th ick and fresh, and tastes a h u ndred t i m e s better t h a n t h o s e packs
of milk you buy i n convenience stores. As I down glass after glass, I suddenly
remember the scene i n Franc;ois Truffaut's fi l m 400 B lows where Antoi n e
runs away from home a n d , early o n e morning, gets h u n gry a n d steal s a bottle
of milk that's been del ivered to some body's front door, th e n drinks it as h e
makes h i s getaway. It's a large bottl e , s o i t takes h i m a wh i l e t o drink it a l l
down . A sad , di stressing scene - though it's hard t o bel i eve that j ust drinking
milk could be so sad . That's another one of the few movies from my c h i ld­
hood. I was i n fifth grade, and th e title caught my attention, so I took the tra i n

to Ikebukuro a l o n e , saw the fi l m , th en rode the tra in back. As soon as I got out
of the theater, I bought some milk and drank it. I couldn't h e l p it.
After drinking all that milk now I get sleepy. An ove rwhe l m i ng, al most
nauseous sleepiness comes over me. My thoughts slow down , and finally
stop, l ike a tra i n p u l l i n g i nto a stati o n , and I can't th ink stra ight anymore , l ike
the core of my body's coagulating. I walk i nto the bedroo m , make a tangle out
of getting my pants and shoes off, then slump down on the bed, bury my fac e
i n t h e p i l l ow, and c l ose m y eyes. T h e p i l l ow s m e l l s l ike t h e s u n l i ght, a pre­
cious smel l . I qui etly breathe it in, breathe i t out, and fal l asleep befo re I
know it.
Whe n I wake u p i t's dark a l l arou n d . I open my eyes and try to figure out
where I a m . Two soldiers led me through the forest to a small town n ext to a
stream, right? S l owly my memory's coming back. The scene comes i nto
focus, and I hear a fam i l iar melody. " Edelweiss." Out in the kitc h e n there's a
fa int, inti mate c lattering of pots and pans. Light spills i n to the bedroom
through a crack i n the door, forming a yel l ow line on the floor. Kind of an
old-fash ioned, powdery yel l ow l ight.
I try to get out of bed but my body's numb all over. I take a deep breath
and look up at the ceil ing. I hear the sound of plates, of someone scurryi n g
b u s i l y across the fl o o r , preparing a m e a l for m e , I i magi n e . I ' m fi n a l l y able to
stand up. Though it takes a wh i l e , I struggle into my pants, my socks and
shoes. Q u i etly I grab the knob and open the door.
A young girl's in th e kitchen cooking. Her back to me, she's leaning over
a pot, tasting the food with a spoo n , but wh en she hears the door open she
looks u p and turns around. It's her. The same girl who visited my room i n the
l i b rary and gazed at the painting on the wal l . Th e fifteen-year-ol d M iss Saek i .
S h e 's wearing t h e s a m e clothes, a long-sleeved , l i gh t b l u e dress . T h e only
th ing different is n ow her hai r's pin ned back. She gives m e a s m a l l , warm
s m i l e , and a powerful emotion overwh elms me, l ike the whole worl d 's been
turned upside down , l ike everyth ing tangible had fal l e n apart but has n ow
been put back togeth er. But this girl is no i l l u s i o n , certa inly no ghost. S h e 's a
l iving, breath i n g young girl , someone you can tou c h , standing in a real
kitchen at twi l ight, cooking me a real meal . Her small breasts jut beneath h e r
dress, her neck as wh ite as porcelain fresh from t h e k i l n . I t's a l l real .
" O h , you 're awake?" she asks .
No voice comes out of m e . I ' m sti l l trying to p u l l myself together.
"You seem to have slept very wel l ," she says . She turns back to tasti n g
t h e dish . " I f y o u d i d n ' t wake up I w a s goi ng t o put t h e meal on t h e table
and leave ."

391

" } wasn't planning to sleep so muc h ," I finally manage to say.

"You came all the way through the forest," she says, "so you must be hu ngry."
" I ' m not sur e . But I th ink I am." I want to reach out and see if I can actually touch her. But I can't. I j ust stand there , drinking her in. I l i sten to the
sounds she makes as she bustles around the kitc h e n .
She l a d l e s hot stew onto a p l a i n white plate and carries it over to t h e
tabl e . There's a bowl of salad, too , tomatoes and greens, and a large l o a f o f
brea d . There a r e potatoes and carrots in th e stew. The fragrance brings back
fond memories. I breathe it all in deeply and realize I'm starving. I have to eat
someth i n g . As I pick up a scuffed fork and spoon and begin eating, the girl s i ts
in a chair to the side and watches me with a serious expression on h e r fac e ,
l ike watc h i n g me e a t is a critical part o f her j o b . Occasionally she brushes
back her hair.
"They told me you 're fifteen," she says .
"That's right," I reply, buttering a slice of bread. " I j ust turned fifte e n . "
" I ' m fifteen too," she says .
I nod. I know that, I almost say. But it's too soon to say that. I take
another bite .
" I ' l l b e making the meals here for a wh i l e ," s h e says . "Th e cleaning and
wash ing as well . There are clothes in the dresser i n the bedroo m , so fee l
free t o help yourself. You can just p u t your laundry i n the basket and I ' l l take
care of it."
" S omebody gave you these j obs?"
She l ooks fixedly at me but doesn't answer. I t's l ike my questi on's taken a
wrong turn and been sucked into some nameless spa c e .
"What's your name?" I ask, trying a different tack.
She shakes her head sl ightly. " I don't have a name. We don't have
names here."
" B u t if you don't have a name, how can I call you ? "
"There's no n e e d t o c a l l me," s h e says . " I f you n e e d m e , I ' l l be here."
" I guess I don't need my name here, either."
She nods. "You 're you, you see, and nobody else. You are you , right? "
" I guess so," I say. Though I ' m not so sure . Am I really m e ?
All t h e wh i l e she's steadily gaz ing at me.
"Do you remember the l ibrary?" I come right out and ask h er.
"Th e l ibrary?" She shakes her head. "No . . . There's a l ibrary fa r away,
but not here."
'Th e re 's a l ibrary?"
"Yes, but there aren't any books in it."

392

"If there aren't any books, then what is there?"
She tilts her head but doesn't respond. Again my question's taken a
wrong turn and vanished.
"Have you ever been there?"
"A long time ago," she says.
"But it's not for reading books?"
She nods. "There aren't any books there."
1 eat in silence for a time. The stew, the salad, the bread. She doesn't say

anything either, just observes me with that serious look.
"How was the food?" she asks after I finish eating.
"It was really good."
"Even without any meat or fish?"
I point to the empty plate. "Well, I didn't leave anything, right?"
"I made it."
"It was really good," I repeat. It's the truth.
Being with her I feel a pain, like a frozen knife stuck in my chest. An
awful pain, but the funny thing is I'm thankful for it. It's like that frozen pain
and my very existence are one. The pain is an anchor, mooring me here. The
girl stands up to boil some water and make tea. While I'm sitting at the table
drinking it, she carries the dirty dishes out to the kitchen and starts washing
them. I watch her do all this. I want to say something, but when I'm with her
words no longer function as they're supposed to. Or maybe the meaning that
ties them together has vanished? I stare at my hands and think of the dog­
wood outside the window, glinting in the moonlight. That's where the blade
that's stabbing me in the heart is.
"Will I see you again?" I ask.
"Of course," the girl replies. "Like I said before, if you need me, I'll
be here."
"You're not going to suddenly disappear?"
She doesn't say anything, just gazes at me with a strange look on her face,
like Where-do-you-think-I'd-go?
"I've met you before," I venture. "In another land, in another library."
"If you say so," she says, touching her hair to check that it's still pinned
back. Her voice is expressionless, like she's trying to let me know the topic
doesn't interest her.
"I think I've come here to meet you one more time. You, and one other
WOIl1an."
She looks up and nods seriously. "Going through the deep woods to
get here."

393

"That's right. I had to see you and that other woman again."
"And you've met me."
I nod.
"It's like I told you," she says. "If you need me, I'll be here."

After she washes up, she puts the pots and plates back on the shelf and drapes
a canvas bag across her shoulder. 'Til be back tomorrow morning," she tells
me. "I hope you get used to being here soon."
I stand at the door and watch as she vanishes into the gloom. I'm alone
again in the little cabin, inside a closed circle. Time isn't a factor here.
Nobody here has a name. She'll be here as long as I need her. She's fifteen
here. Eternally fifteen, I imagine. But what's going to happen to me? Am I
going to stay fifteen here? Is age, too, not a factor here?
I stand in the doorway long after she's disappeared, gazing vacantly at the
scenery outside. There's no moon or stars in the sky. Lights are on in a few
other buildings, spilling out of the windows. The same antique, yellowish
light that illuminates this roOI11. But I still can't see anybody else. Just the
lights. Dark shadows widen their grip on the world outside. Farther in the dis­
tance, blacker than the darkness, the ridge rises up, and the forest surround­
ing this town like a wall.

Chapter 46

A

fter Nakata 's death , Hoshino couldn't pull h i mself away fro m the
apartment. With the entrance stone there, someth i n g might happen ,
and when it

did he wanted

to be close enough that he c o u l d react i n

time. Watc h i n g over the stone h a d been Nakata's j o b , a n d n ow i t w a s h i s . H e
set the A C i n Nakata's room t o the lowest possible temperature a n d turned i t
on ful l blast, c hecking that the windows were shut tight. The a i r i n the room
had that special solidity found only in a room with a c orpse i n it. "Not too
cold for you , I hope?" he said to Nakata , who naturally didn't have a n opinion
one way or the other.
Hoshino plopped down on the l ivi ng-room sofa , trying to pass the time.
He didn't feel l ike l istening to music or reading. Twi l ight came on, the room
by degrees turning dark, but he didn't even get up to switch on the l ight. He
fel t completely dra i ned , and once ensconced on the sofa couldn't rouse h im­
self enough to get up. Time came slowly and passed slowly, so lei s u rely that at
ti mes he could swea r i t had stealth ily doubled back on itself.
When h i s own grandfather died , he th ought, it was hard, but noth i ng l ike
th i s . He'd suffered through a long i l l ness, and they all knew it was j ust a mat­
ter of time. So when he did die, they were prepared . It makes a b i g difference
whether or not you have a chance to steel yourself for the inevitable. B u t
that's not t h e only difference, H o s h i n o concluded . There w a s someth i n g
a b o u t Nakata 's death t h a t forced h i m t o th ink long and hard .
S uddenly h u ngry, he went to the kitchen , defrosted some fried rice i n the
m i c rowave, and ate half of it along with a beer. Afterward he went back to
check on Nakata . Maybe he'd come back to l i fe, he thought. B u t n o , the old
man was stil l dead . The room was l ike a walk-in freezer, so cold you could
store ice cream i n there.
Spendi ng a night in the same house as a corpse was a fi rst, and H o s h i n o
c o u l d n ' t settle down . Not that h e w a s scared or anyth ing, he t o l d h i m self.

395

I t di dn 't make h i s flesh craw!' He j ust didn 't know h ow he should act with a
dead man beside h i m . The flow of time is so different for the dead and th e l iv­
ing. Same with sounds . That's why I can't calm down, he decided. B u t what
can you do? Mr. Nakata's already gone over to the world of th e dead, a n d I ' m
still i n the l a n d of th e l iving. O f course there's going be a gap . H e got u p from
the sofa and sat down next to the stone. He started stroki n g it with h i s palms,
l ike h e was petti ng a cat.
"What the heck am I supposed to do?" he asked th e sto ne . "I want to tu rn
Mr. Nakata over to somebody who'll take care of h i m , but until I take c a re of
you, I can 't. You want to clue me in?"
B u t there was n o reply. For th e moment th e stone was j ust a sto n e , a n d
Hosh i n o understood th i s . He c o u l d a s k t i l l he w a s blue i n the face b u t
couldn ' t expect a response. Even so, he s a t beside the sto n e , rubbi n g it. H e
tossed out a c o u p l e questions, made an appeal t o logi c , and did h i s b e s t t o w i n
the sympathy vote . Though he knew it was pointless, h e couldn ' t th ink of a n
alternative . M r . Nakata had s a t here all the ti me talki n g t o th e sto n e , so why
shouldn't he?
Sti l l , talking to a stone, trying to get it to feel your pain-that's pretty
patheti c , he thought. I mean, isn't that where they get that expression?

As heartless as a stone?
He stood up, th inking he'd watch th e news on TV, but thought better of
it and sat down aga i n beside th e stone . S ilence is probably best for n ow, he
decided. Cot to l i sten carefully, wait for whatever it is that's going to happe n .
" B u t waiting around i s n ' t exactly m y th ing," Hosh i n o s a i d t o the sto n e . C o m e
t o th ink of i t , I 've always been the impatient type , and man h ave I p a i d for i t!
Always leaping before I look, always screwing th ings u p . You 're as antsy as a
cat in heat, my grandpa used to tell me. But now I 've got to s i t tight a n d wait.
Cut i t out!
Everyth ing was quiet except for the groan of th e AC goi ng ful l blast next
door. The clock showed nine, then ten , but noth i ng happened. Tim e passed,
th e night grew deeper, nothing else. Hosh i n o dragged his blankets i n to th e
l iving room , lay down on the sofa , and pulled th em ove r h i m . He figu red that
it was better, even asleep, to be near the stone i n case someth i ng happened.
H e tu rned off the l ight and shut h i s eyes.
" Hey, stone! I ' m goi ng to sleep now," h e called out. "We'll talk aga i n
tom orrow. I t's been a long day, a n d I need some shut-eye ." M a n , h e thought,
was that a n understatement. Long did not begin to describe it. " H ey,
Cramps!" he called out more loudly. "Mr. Nakata? You h ea r m e ? " No reply.
Hosh i n o sighed, closed his eyes, adj usted his pillow, and fel l asleep. He

slept the whole n i ght without a break, without a si ngle dre a m . I n th e n ext
room , Nakata slept h i s own deep, dreamless, stone-hard sleep.
As soon as h e got u p , j ust past seven th e next morning, H o s h i n o went
right i n to check on Nakata . As before , the AC was roaring ful l blast, blowing
cold a i r i n to the room . And i n th e midst of that ch illed room , N akata was sti l l
dead. C ompared t o t h e night before, death s e e m e d t o h ave a tighte r g r i p o n
h i m . H i s skin had grown ashen, h i s closed eyes m o r e fi x e d a n d sol e m n .
H e wasn't a b o u t t o c o m e back t o l ife , suddenly s i t u p , and say,

My apologies,
Mr. Hoshino. Nakata just fell asleep. I'm sorry. No need to worry, I'll take it
from here-and th e n deal with th e stone. That was never going to happen .
Nakata's checked out for good, Hosh ino thought, and that's a fact.
H e started s h ivering from th e cold, so h e stepped out a n d shut th e door,
then went i n to the kitchen, brewed some coffee in the coffe emaker a n d
drank two cups, made s o m e toast and ate it with butter and j a m . After eating
he sat i n th e kitc h e n , smoked a couple of cigarettes, and gazed out the w i n­
dow. The clouds had blown away someti me du ring th e night, leaving a n
u nbroken s u n ny summer sky. T h e stone w a s i n i ts customary s p o t n ext t o the
sofa . It didn 't sleep a wink, di dn 't wake up, j ust crouched the re , u n moving,
the entire night. H e tried picking it up and easily l i fted it.
" Hey th ere," Hoshino said i n a cheerful voic e , " i t's me. You r old pal
Hosh i n o , remember? Looks l ike it's j ust you and m e today."
The stone was - not unexpectedly - speechless.
"Ah , that's okay. Doesn't matter if you don't remember. We have lots of
ti me to get to know each other - no need to rush."
H e sat down beside th e ston e , started rubbing it, and wondered what sort
of th i ngs you might talk about with a ston e . Having a conversati o n w i th a
stone was a fi rst and he couldn't th ink of any appropriate top i c s . Best to avoid
anyth i ng diffi c u l t th is early i n the morning, h e figured. The day was long, and
whateve r popped i n to his head would be fi n e .
H e gave i t some thought and c h o s e a favorite subj ect: g i r l s . H e reviewed
each and eve ry girl h e 'd ever slept with . I f he stuck to th e ones whose names
he remembered, it didn 't add up to all that many. H e counted th e m off o n his
fingers . S ix, all told. I f I add th e ones whose names I don ' t know, h e thought,
there'd be a lot more, but we'll put those on hold.
" I guess i t's pretty pointless talking to a stone about girls I 've slept with ,"
he said. "And I suppose you aren't exactly th rilled to hear all about my
exploits fi rst th i n g in the morning. But I can't th ink of a nyth i n g else, okay?
Who knows, maybe some l i ghter topic'll do you some good for a change.
FYI and all that."

397

H osh i n o related some episodes in as much deta i l as he could recal l . The
first was when he was i n h igh school , back when he was i n to motorcycles and
getti ng i n to troubl e . The girl was th ree years older tha n h i m and worked in a
l i ttl e bar i n G i fu C ity. They pretty much l ived togeth e r for a wh i l e . The girl
was serious about the relationsh ip, said she couldn ' t l ive without h i m . She
phoned my parents , h e remembered, but they were no ne too happy about it,
and the whole th i n g was getti ng too intense, so once 1 graduated from h i gh
school 1 j oined the Self-Defense Force . Right after 1 j oi n e d up 1 got stationed
at a base i n Yamanashi Prefectur e , and the relationsh ip fizzled out. 1 never
saw her aga i n .
" I guess lazy's m y middle name," Hosh i n o expla i n e d t o the sto n e . "And
when th i ngs get sticky 1 tend to head for th e door. Not to brag or a nyth i ng, b u t
I ' m pretty quick o n my feet. I 've never followed anyth i n g t o the b i tter e n d .
Wh i c h is s o r t of a probl e m , 1 suppose."
The second girl he met near th e base i n Yamanas h i . H e was off duty o n e
day and h e l p e d her fix a flat on her Suzuki Alto . S h e w a s a y e a r olde r tha n
h i m and attendi n g nursing school .
" Sh e was a n ice kid," Hosh ino said to the sto ne . " B i g breasts , a very warm
perso n . And man, did she l ike to get it on! I was only n i n etee n , a n d we used
to spend every day between the sheets . Probl em was, she was j ealous l ike you
wouldn ' t believe . I f 1 didn 't see her on my days off she'd give m e th e th i rd
degre e , ask where 1 went, what 1 did, who 1 was with . 1 tol d her the truth , b u t
that didn 't satisfy h er. That's w h y w e broke up. We w e r e togethe r f o r a b o u t a
year, 1 guess.... 1 don ' t know how you are, but I can't stand anyone gettin g
o n my case. 1 feel l ike 1 c a n ' t breath e , and it makes m e depressed. S o 1 ran
away. The cool th ing about the SDF is you can always hole up on base till the
whole th ing bl ows over. And th ere's noth i n g anybody can do about it. If you
want to dump a girl with no problems, goi ng i n to th e S D F's you r ticket.
Good th i n g to remember. But it's not all roses - not with digging foxholes
and p i l i ng up sandbags and crap."
The more h e talked, the more Hosh ino rea l i zed h ow pointless his l ife
had been. Four of th e six girls h e 'd gone out with had been n i c e . (The oth e r
two , i f y o u l ooked at it obj ectively, h a d personality p roble m s , h e dec i ded.)
Most of the m had treated him pretty wel l . No drop-dead beauties among
th e m , though each was cute i n her own way, and let him have sex whenever
h e fel t l ike it. Never complained if he skipped foreplay and went stra ight to
the m a i n course . They fixed meals for h i m on h i s days off, bought h i m pres­
ents on his b i rthday, lent him money when h e was a l i ttle short before pay­
day - not that h e ever remembered paying th em back-and they never

demanded anyth i ng in retu rn . Al l th i s , and I was an u ngratefu l bastard, h e
concluded. I took everyth ing for granted.
To his credit, h e 'd never c heated on any of th e m . But let th e m complain
a l i ttl e , try t o w i n a n a rgume nt, show a b i t of j eal ousy, urge h i m t o save some
money, get a l i ttle overwrought, or express even a h i n t of worry about the
future, and h e was out of there . H e always figu red th e most i m portant th i ng
about girls was to avoid any sticky situations, so all it took was o n e tiny wave to
rock the boat a n d he was gon e . H e 'd find a new girl and start over. H e was
sure most people di d th e same.
" I f I were a gi rl ," he said to the stone, "and was going out with a self­
centered bastard l ike me, I 'd blow my stack. I ' m sure of it, now that I look back
on it. I don't know h ow they all put up with me for so long. I t's amazing." He
lit a Marlboro a nd, slowly exhaling smoke , rubbed the stone with one h and.
"Am I right or what? I'm not so good-looking, no great shakes in bed. Don't
have much money. Not such a great personal ity, not too bright. A lot of nega­
tives here. Son of a poor fa rmer from the sticks, a no-good ex-sol di er-tu rned­
truck-driver. When I th i nk back on it, though , I was really l ucky when it came
to girls. I wasn't very popular, but I always had a gi rl friend. Someone who let
me sleep with her, who fed me, lent me money. But you know someth i ng?
Good th i ngs don't last foreve r. I feel that more and more as time goes by. I t's
l ike somebody's sayi ng,

Hey, Hoshino, someday you're gonna have to pay up."

He rubbed th e stone wh i l e relati ng h i s a morous adventures. H e 'd gotten
so used to rubb i n g it that he didn 't want to stop. At noon a school c h i m e
rang o u t , a n d h e w e n t t o the kitchen t o make a bowl of u do n , adding
some scallions along with a raw egg. After lunch he l istened aga i n to the

Archduke Tri o .
" H ey, sto n e ," h e called o u t right after t h e first movement e n ded. " Pretty
nice mus i c , h u h ? Really makes you feel l ike your heart's opening u p , don ' t
y o u th ink?"
Th e stone was s i l e nt.
H e had n o idea i f the stone was l i ste ning, to the music o r to h i m , but h e
forged ahead a nyway. "Like I was sayi ng th is morning, I 've don e s o m e awful
th i ngs in my l i fe . I was pretty self-centered. And it's too late to erase it all n ow,
you know? But when I l i sten to th is music it's l i ke B eethoven's right h ere talk­
ing to m e , tel l i ng me someth i ng l ike ,

It's okay, Hoshino, don't worry about it.
That's life. I've done some pretty awful things in my life too. Not much you can
do about it. Things happen. You just got to hang in there. B eethoven being the
guy h e was , h e 's not about to say anyth ing l ike that. B u t I'm sti l l p i c k i ng up
that vibe from his mus i c , l ike that's what it's sayi ng to me. Can you feel it?"

The stone was mute.
"Whatever," Hoshino said. "That's j ust my opinion . I ' l l shut u p so we
can l i sten ."
When he l ooked outside at two, a fat black cat was sitting on the ra i l i n g
o n t h e veranda , gazing in at t h e apartment. B ored, Hosh i n o o p e n e d the
window and called out, " H ey there, kitty. Nice day, isn't it?"
"Yes, indeed, i t is a fi n e day, Mr. Hoshi no," the cat rep l i ed.
" G i m m e a break," Hosh ino said, shaking his head.

The Boy Named Crow

T

h e b o y n a m e d C row fl e w i n large, langu i d circles above t h e forest.
After i nscribing one, h e 'd fly off to another spot and carefully begin
another, i dentical circle , each invisible circle fol l owing another in

the a i r only to vanish . Like a reconnaissance plane, he scanned the forest
below h i m , looking for someone he couldn ' t seem to locate . Like a h uge
ocean, th e forest u n dulated beneath h i m and spread to the horizon in a th ick,
anonymous cloak of i n terlaced branches. The sky was c overed with gray
clouds , and there was neither wind nor sunlight. At th is point the boy n a m ed
C row had to be the loneliest bird in the world, but he was too busy to th ink
about that now.
He finally spotted an opening in the sea of trees below and shot stra ight
down through it to an open piece of ground. The l ight shone on a small patch
of ground that was marked with grass . In one corner of the clearing was a large
round rock and a man in a bright red sweat suit and a black silk hat was sitting
on it. He wore thick-soled h iking boots , and a khaki-colored bag lay on the
ground beside h i m . A strange getup, though the boy named C row didn 't mi nd.
Th is was who he was after. What the man had on was of l i ttle consequence.
The m a n l o oked up at the sudden flapping of wi ngs a n d saw C row land
on a large bra n c h . "H ey," he said cheerfully.
The boy named C row didn 't make any reply. Resting on the bran c h , h e
gazed, unbl i nking, express ionless, at t h e m an . Occasionally h e 'd i n c l i n e h i s
head t o one s i de .
" I know w h o you are," the m a n said. H e doffed h i s h a t a n d put i t back o n .
" I h a d a fee l i n g you'd be coming here before long." H e cleared h i s throat,
frown ed, and spat on the ground, then stamped the spit i n to th e dirt with
h i s boot.
"I was j ust resti ng, and feel i n g a bit bored with no one to talk to. H ow
about coming ove r here? We can have a nice l i ttle talk. What do you say?
I 've n ever seen you before , but that doesn't mean we 're total strangers."

The boy named C row kept h i s mouth shut, holdi n g h i s wings c l ose i n
aga i nst h i mself.
The man i n the silk hat l ightly shook h i s head. " Ah , I s e e . You can't
speak, can you? No matter. I ' ll do the talking, i f you don ' t m i nd. I know what
you 're goi ng to do, even if you don't say a word. You don ' t want m e to go
any fu rth er, do you ? I t's so obvi ous I can predict what' l l happe n . You don ' t
w a n t me t o g o any further, but that's exactly w h a t I w a n t t o do . Because it's a
golden opportunity I can't let slip th rough my fi ngers - a once-in-a-l i feti m e
opportunity."
H e gave th e ankle of his h iking boots a good slap. "To leap to th e c o n­
clusion here, you won't be able to stop m e . You aren't qua l i fi ed. Let's say I
play my fl u te , what's going to happen? You won't be able to come any closer
to me. That's the power of my flute . You might not know th i s , but it's a u n i qu e
kind of fl ute , not j ust s o m e ordinary, everyday i nstru ment. A n d actually I 've
got quite a few here in my bag."
The man reached out and carefully patted th e bag, th en l ooked up aga i n
at the b o y n a m e d C row perched on h i s branch . " I made th is fl u te out of th e
souls of cats I 've collected. Cut out th e souls of cats wh i l e they were sti l l al ive
and made them i n to th is flute . I felt sorry for th e cats , of course, c u tting th e m
up l ike that, b u t I couldn't help it. Th is flute is beyond a n y world's standa rds
of good and evi l , l ove or hatred. Making th ese fl u tes has been my longti m e
c a l l i ng, and I 've always done a decent j ob o f ful fi l l i ng my role and doing m y
b it. Noth i n g t o be ashamed of. I got marri ed, had c h i l dren , and made more
tha n enough fl u tes. So I'm not goi ng to make any more . Just betwee n you and
me, I'm th inking of taking all th e flutes I 've made and creating a much larger,
far more powerful flute out of them - a super-s ize fl u te that becomes a syste m
unto itself. Right now I ' m heading to a place where I can construct that kind
of fl u te . I'm not the one who decides whether that fl u te tu rns out to be good
or evi l , and neither are you . It all depends on when and where I am. I n
tha t sense I ' m a m a n totally without prej udices, l ike h istory or th e weath e r­
completely unbiased. And since I a m , I can transform i n to a kind of syste m . "
H e re moved h is silk hat, rubbed th e th inning h a i r o n top of h i s h ead, p u t
th e hat b a c k o n , and qu ickly adj usted t h e bri m . "Once I p l a y th i s fl ute , get­
ting rid of you will be a snap. The th ing is, I don't feel l ike playing it right
now. It takes a lot out of m e , and I don't want to waste any strength . I'll need
all of it l ater o n . But whether I play the flute or n ot, you can't stop me. That
should be obvious."
The man cl eared h i s th roat once more, and rubbed the sl ight swel l of h i s

402

belly. " D o you know what l i mbo is? It's the ne utral point between l i fe and
death . A kind of sad, gloomy place. Where I am n ow, i n other words-th is
forest. I di ed, at my own biddi ng, but haven't gone on to th e next world. I ' m a
soul i n transiti o n , and a soul i n transition is formless. I 've m e rely adopted th is
form for th e time being. That's why you can't h u rt m e . You fol l ow m e ? Even
if I were to bleed all over the place, it's not real blood. Even if I were to suffer
h orribly, it's not real suffering. The only one who could wipe me out right
now is someone wh o's qual ified to do so. And-sad to say - you don ' t fi t the
bill. You 're noth i ng more than an i m mature, mediocre i l l u s i o n . No matter
how determined you may be, e l i m i nating me's i mposs ible for the l ikes of
you ." The man looked at the boy named C row and beamed. " H ow 'bout i t?
Want to give it a try?"
As if that was th e signal he'd been wa iting for, th e boy named C row
spread h i s wings wide , leaped off th e bra n c h , and darted stra ight at h i m . H e
seized t h e m a n 's c h est with both talons, drew h i s head b a c k , a n d brought h i s
beak down on th e man's right eye , pecking away fiendishly l ike h e w a s hack­
ing away with a p i ckax, his jet black wi ngs flapping noisily all th e w h i l e . The
man put up n o resistance, didn 't l i ft a fi nger to protect h i mself. H e didn 't c ry
out, eith e r. I nstead, he laughed out loud. H i s hat fell to th e ground, a n d h i s
eyeball w a s s o o n shredded and hanging from its socket. The b o y n a m e d
C row tenaciously attacked th e other eye now. O n c e both eyes w e r e replaced
by vacant cavities, h e turned immediately to the man's fac e , pecking away,
slash i n g it a l l over. H i s face was soon cut to ribbons, p i eces of skin flying
off, blood spurting out, noth ing more than a l u m p of reddish flesh . C row
next attacked the top of h i s head, where th e h a i r was th i n n est, and sti l l
the man kept on laugh i ng. T h e more vicious th e attack b e c a m e , t h e louder
he l aughed, as if th e whole s i tuation was so h i larious h e couldn't control
h i mself.
The man n ever took h i s eyes - now vacant sockets - off C row, and i n
between laughs managed t o choke o u t a few words . " Se e , what'd I tel l you?
Don't make m e laugh . You can try all you want, but it's not going to h u rt m e .
You 're not qual ified t o d o that. You're j ust a fl i msy i l l u s i o n , a c h e a p e c h o .
I t's useless, no matte r what y o u do . D o n ' t y o u g e t it?"
The boy named C row stabbed at th e mouth these words had come from .
H i s h uge wi ngs ceasel essly beat at th e air, a few shiny black feath e rs coming
loose , swirl i ng i n the a i r l ike fragments of a sou l . C row tore at th e m a n 's
tongue , grabbed it with h i s beak, and yanked with all h i s m i ght. It was long
and hugely th ick, a n d once it was pulled out fro m deep with i n th e m a n 's

throat, it squ i rmed l ike a gigantic moll usk, forming dark word s . Without a
tongue, h oweve r, not even th is man could laugh anymore . He looked l ike h e
c o u l d n ' t breath e , either, but still he h e l d h i s s i d e s and s h o o k with soundless
laugh ter. The boy named C row l istened, and th is u n h eard laughte r-as
vacant and ominous as wind blowing over a far-off desert - n ever cease d .
It s o u n d e d , i n fact, very m u c h l ike an otherworl dly Aute .

Chapter 47

!

Wake up j ust after dawn , boil water on the electric hot plate , a n d make
some tea . I sit down beside th e window to see what, i f anyth i ng , is going
o n outs i de . Everyth ing is dead quiet, with no sign of anybody o n the

street. Even the b i rds seem rel uctant to launch i n to the i r usual morning
chorus. The h ills to the east a re barely edged i n a fa i n t l ight. The place is sur­
rounded by h i gh h i l l s , wh ich expla ins why dawn comes so late a n d twi l ight so
early. I go over to th e nightstand where my watch is to check the ti m e , but th e
digital screen's a compl ete blank. When I push a few buttons at rando m ,
noth i ng happen s . T h e batteries should sti l l b e good, b u t for s o m e u n fath­
omable reason th e th i n g stopped wh ile I was sleeping. I put th e watc h back
on top of my p i l l ow and rub my left wrist, where I normally wear i t, with my
right.

Not that time's much of a factor here.

As I gaze at th e vacant, b i rdless scene outs ide , I suddenly want to read a
book - any book. As long as it's shaped l ike a book and has printing, i t's fi n e
b y m e . I j ust w a n t t o h o l d a b o o k i n my hands , tu rn the pages, scan the words
with my eye s . Only one problem - th ere isn't a book i n s i ght. In fact, i t's l ike
printing hasn't been invented here. I quickly look around the room , and sure
enough , th ere's noth i ng at all with any writi ng on it.
I open the chest of drawers i n the bedroom to see what kind of clothes a re
inside . Eve ryth i ng's neatly folded. None of th e clothes are new. The col ors
are faded, the material soft from countless was h ings. S ti l l , they look c l e a n .
Th ere's round-neck s h i rts , underwear, socks, cotton s h i rts with c o l l a r s , and
cotton trousers. Not a perfect fi t, but pretty much my s i z e . All the clothes are
perfectly plain and des ign-free , l ike the whole i dea of clothes w i th patterns
never existed. None of the m have any makers' labels - so much for any writ­
ing th ere . I exchange my smelly T-sh i rt for a gray one from th e drawer that
smells like sunl ight and soap .

A while later�how much later I couldn't say�the girl arrives. S h e taps
l i ghtly on the door and, without wa iting for an a nswer, opens it. The doo r
doesn't h a v e any kind of lock. Her canvas b a g is s l u n g o v e r her shoulder. The
sky b e h i n d her is al ready l i ght.
She goes stra ight to the kitchen and cooks some eggs i n a small black fry­
i n g pan. Th ere's a pleasant sizzle as th e eggs h i t th e hot o i l , and the fresh
cooking smells waft through the room . Meanwh i l e , she toasts some bread in
a squat l i ttl e toaste r that looks like a prop from an old movi e . H e r clothes a n d
h a i r a re th e same as th e night before�a l ight blue dress, h a i r p i n n e d back.
H e r skin is so smooth and beautifu l , and her slim, porcela in-like arms gl isten
i n the morning sun. Through the open window a tiny bee buzzes in, as if to
make the world a l i ttle more complete . The girl carries the food over to the
table , sits in a chair, and watches me eat the vegetable omelette a n d b u ttered
toast and drink some herb tea . She doesn't eat or dri nk a nyth ing. The whole
th i n g's a repeat of last night.
" Don't people here cook their own meals?" I ask her. " I was wondering
because you 're making meals for me."
" Some people make th eir own , others have somebody make meals for
th e m ," she repl ies. " Mostly, though, people here don 't eat very m u c h . "
" Really?"
S h e nods.

"Sometimes they eat. Wh en they want to ."

"You mean n o one else eats as much as I do? "
" C a n y o u g e t by without eating for one whole day? "
I shake my head.
" Folks here often go a whole day without eating, n o problem . They actually forget to eat, sometimes for days at a time."
"I'm not used to th i ngs here yet, so I have to eat."
" I suppose so," she says . 'That's why I ' m cooking for you ."
I look i n her fac e . " H ow long will it take for m e to get used to th is place?"
" How long?" she parrots, and slowly shakes her h ead. " I h ave n o i de a . I t's
not a questi on of time. Wh en that time comes, you'll a l ready be used to it."
We 're s i tting across from each other, her hands neatly l in e d u p on th e
table , palms down . Her ten l i ttl e resol ute fingers are there, real ob j e cts before
me. D i rectly across from her, I catch each tiny flutter of her eyelashes, count
each blink of h e r eyes, watch the strands of hair swayi ng ove r h e r forehead.
I can't take my eyes off her.

"That time?"

I say.

" I t isn't l ike you'll cut someth i ng out of yourself and throw it away," s h e
says . "We don't th row it away�we accept i t , inside u s . "

"And I ' l l accept th is inside of me?"
'That's right."
"And the n ? " I ask. "After I accept it, then what happens?"
S h e inclines her head sligh tly as she th i nks, a n utte rly n atural gesture.
The strands of h a i r sway aga i n . "Th en you'll become compl etely yourself,"
she says .
" S o you mean up ti ll now I haven't been completely m e ? "
"You a r e totally yourself even now," she says, then th i nks it over. "What
I mean is a l i ttl e different. But I can't expl a i n it wei!."
"You can't understand until it actually happe ns?"
S h e nods.
Whe n it gets too pai nful to watch her anymore , I close my eyes. Then I
open th e m right away, to make sure she's still there . " I s it sort of a c o m munal
l i festyle here?"
S h e conside rs th i s . "Eve ryone does l ive together, a n d share c e rta i n
th ings. Like the shower room s , the electrical stati o n , the m a rket. There a re
certa i n s i m p l e , unspoken agreements in place, but noth i ng compl i cated .
Noth i n g you need to th ink about, or even put into word s . So th ere isn't
anyth i ng I need to teach you about how th ings are done. Th e most i mportant
th ing about l i fe here is that people let th emselves be absorbed i n to th i ngs. As
long as you do that, there won't be any problems."
"What do you mean by absorbed?"
" I t's like when you 're i n th e forest, you become a seamless part of it.
When you 're i n the ra i n , you're a part of the ra i n . When you 're i n the morning,
you're a seamless part of the morning. When you 're with me, you become a
part of m e . "
"When you 're with m e , the n , you're a seamless part of m e ? "
"That's true . "
"What d o e s it feel l ike? To be yourself and part of me at the s a m e ti m e ? "
S h e l ooks stra ight at me and touches her h a i rp i n . " I t's very n atura!. O n c e
you 're u s e d t o i t , it's quite s i m p l e . L i k e flying."
"You can fly?"
"Just an

example,"

she says, and smiles. I t's a smile with o u t any deep or

h i dden meaning, a smile for the sake of smili ng. "You can't know what flying
feels l ike until you actually do it. It's th e same,"
"So it's a natural th ing you don't even h ave to th ink about?"
S h e nods. "Yes, it's quite natural, calm, qui et, someth i ng you don't have
to th i n k about. I t's seamless,"
"Am I asking too many questions?"

"N ot at a l l ," she repl ies. "I only wish I could expla i n th i ngs better."
"Do you have memories?"
Aga i n she shakes her head and rests her hands on the table , th is time with
the palms faceup. She glances at th em express ionlessly.
"No , I don 't. In a place where time isn't i m portant, neith e r i s memory.
Of course I remember last night, coming here and making vegetable stew.
And you ate it a l l , didn 't you? The day before that I remember a bit of. B u t
a nyth ing before that, I don't know. Ti me h a s been absorbed i n s i de m e , a n d I
c a n 't distinguish between one object and whateve r's beside it."
"So memory isn't so important here?"
S h e beams. "That's right. Memory isn't so i mportant here. The l ibrary
handles memories."
After the girl leaves, I sit by the window holdi n g my hand out i n the
morning s u n , its shadow fal lin g on the windows i l l , a distinct five-fi nger o u t­
l i n e . The bee stops buzzing around and qu ietly lands above th e windowp a n e .
I t seems t o have s o m e seriolls th inking t o do . A n d so d o I .

Whe n th e sun is a l i ttle bit p a s t its highest point, she comes to where I'm stay­
ing, knocks l ightly, and opens the door. For a moment I can't tel l who I ' m
looking at - th e young girl or

her.

A sl ight s h i ft i n l ight, or th e way t h e wind

blows , i s all it takes for her to change completely. I t's l ike i n one i nstant she
transforms i nto the young girl , a moment later changing back i nto M iss
Saeki . Not that th is really takes place. The person i n front of me i s , without a
doubt, Miss Saeki and no other.
"H ello," she says in a natural tone of voice, j ust l ike when we passed i n the
corridor of the library. She's wearing a long-sl eeved navy blue blouse and a
matc h i n g knee-length skirt, a th in silver necklace, and small pearl earri ngs­
exactly as I'm used to seeing her. Her h i gh heels make short, dry c l i cks as she
steps onto the porc h , a sound that's slightly out of place here . S h e stands gaz­
ing at me from th e doorway, as if she's checking to see whether it's th e real me
or not. Of course it's the real me. Just l ike she's the real M iss Saeki .
"How about coming in for a cup of tea?" I say.
'Td l ike that," she says . And, l ike she's finally worked up the n e rve, s h e
steps ins i de .
I g o t o the kitchen a n d tu rn o n the stove t o boil water, trying t o get m y
breath i n g back to normal .
S h e s i ts down at th e di ning table in the same c h a i r the girl had j ust b e e n
sitting i n . " I t feels l ike we're back in t h e l ibrary, doesn't i t ? " she says.

" S u re does," I agre e . " Except for no coffe e , and no Osh i m a . "
"And not a book i n sight," she says .
I make two cups of herbal tea and carry the m out to the table , s i tting
across from h e r. B i rds c h i rp outside the open window. The b e e 's sti l l napping
above th e windowp a n e .
M iss Saeki's th e fi rst one t o speak. " I w a n t y o u t o k n o w i t w a s n ' t e a s y for
m e to come h e r e . But I had to see you , and talk with you ."
I nod. 'Tm glad you came."
Her tradem a rk smile plays around her l i p s . "There's someth i n g I have to
tell you ." H e r s m i l e 's nearly identical to th e young girl's, th ough with a bit
more depth , a slight nuance that m oves m e .
S h e wraps h e r hands around the teacup. I ' m gaz i n g at th e t i n y pearl
piercings in h e r ears. She's th inking, and it's taking her longer tha n usual .
" I burned up all my memories," she says, deliberately c h oosing her
words . "They went u p i n smoke and disappeared i n to th e a i r. S o 1 won't be
able to remember th i ngs for very long. All sorts of th i ngs�i n c l u di n g my time
with you. That's why I wanted to see you and talk with you as soon as I could.
Wh i l e I can sti ll remember."
I crane my neck and look up at th e bee above th e window, i ts l i ttle black
shadow a single dot on the s i l l .
"Th e m o s t i mportant th ing," she says quietly, " i s you 've g o t t o g e t out o f
here . A s fast as y o u c a n . Leave h e r e , g o th rough t h e woods , and b a c k t o th e
l i fe you left. The entrance is goi ng to close soon . Promise me you w i l l . "
I shake my h ead. "You don't understand th i s , M iss Saek i , but I don ' t have
any world to go back to . No one's ever really loved me, o r wanted me, my
enti re l i fe . I don ' t know who to count on other than myself. For me, the i dea
of a

life I left

is meani ngless."

" B u t you sti l l h ave to go back."
" Even i f th ere's noth i n g there? Even if nobody cares i f I'm th ere or not?"
"That's not why," she says. " I t's what I want. For you to be there."
" B u t you're not there, are you ?"
S h e looks down at her hands clasping the teacup. " N o , I ' m not. I ' m not
th ere a nymore ."
"What do you want fro m me if 1 do go back?'·
"Just one th ing," she says, ra ising her head and looking me stra ight in th e

everybody else forgets ."
S i l e n c e descends on us for a ti m e . A profound s i l e n c e .
A qu estio n w e l l s u p inside m e , a questi on so big it pl ugs u p my th roat a n d

makes it hard to breath e . I somehow swallow it back, fi n a l l y choosing
a nother. "Are memories such an important th ing?"
" I t depends ," she repl ies, and lightly closes her eyes. " I n some cases
they're th e most i m portant th ing there is."
"Yet you burned yours up."
" I had no use for them anymore ." Miss Saeki bri ngs her hands together
on th e table, her palms down th e way the young g i rl 's were the first ti m e .
" Kafka? I have a favor t o ask. I want you t o take that pa i n ting with you . "
"You m e a n th e one i n m y room in th e libra ry? T h e pa i n ti n g of th e
shore?"
M iss Saeki n ods . "Yes,

Kafka on the Shore.

I want you to take it. Where ,

I don ' t care. Wherever you 're goi ng."
" B u t doesn't it belong to somebody? "
She shakes her h ead. " I t's mine. He gave it to me as a present when h e
went away t o coll ege i n Tokyo . Ever s i n c e then I 've had i t with m e . Wherever
I l ived, I always hung it on the wall i n my roo m . Wh e n I started working
at the Komura Library I put it back in that room , where i t fi rst h u ng, but
that was j ust tem porary. I left a letter for Osh i m a i n my desk i n the l ibrary
tel l i ng h i m I wanted you to have th e pa inting. After a l l , the pa inting i s origi­
nally

yours."

"Mine?"
S h e n ods . "You were th ere . And I was there beside you , watc h i n g you .
On the shore, a long ti m e ago. The wind was blowing, the re were white puffy
clouds , and it was always summer."
I close my eyes. I'm at th e beach and it's summer. I'm lying back on a
deck c h a i r. I can feel the rough ness of its canvas on my ski n . I breathe i n
deeply th e s m e l l of the s e a a n d th e tide . Even with my eyes closed, th e s u n i s
glaring. I c a n h e a r th e sound of th e waves lappi ng at t h e shore. T h e sound
recedes, the n draws closer, as if ti me is making it quiver. Nearby, someone is
pa i n ting a picture of m e . And beside h i m sits a young girl i n a short-sl e eved
l ight blue dress, gazing i n my di rection. She has stra ight h a i r , a straw hat with
a white ribbon, and she's scooping up the sand. Steady, long fi ngers - th e
fi ngers of a pianist. Her smooth-as-porcela i n arms gl isten i n th e sunl ight.
A natu ral-looking smile plays at her l ips . I'm i n love with h e r. And she's in
l ove with m e .
That's t h e m e mory.
"I want you to have that pa inting with you foreve r," M i ss Saeki says . S h e
stands u p , goes t o th e window, a n d looks outs ide . T h e s u n 's sti l l h i gh i n th e

sky. The bee's sti l l asleep. M iss Saeki holds up a hand to s h i e l d her eyes a n d
looks at someth i n g fa r off, th e n tu rns t o face m e . "You h a v e t o g o , " she says .
I go over to her. H e r ear brushes aga inst my neck, the earring h a rd aga inst
my ski n . I rest both palms on her back l ike I'm deciphering some s i gn th ere.
Her h a i r brushes my cheek. S h e holds me tight, her fi ngers digging hard i n to
my back. F i ngers c l i nging to the wall that's time. The s m e l l of the sea, the
sound of waves breaking on the shore . Someone c a l l i ng my name from far,
far away.
"Are you my mother?" I ' m finally able to ask.
"You a l ready know the a nswer to that," Miss Saeki says .
She's right - I do know the answer. But neither one of us c a n put it i n to
words . Putting it i n to words will destroy any meaning.
"A long time ago I abandoned someone I shouldn't have," she says .
" Someone I l oved more than anyth ing else. I was afra i d someday I 'd lose th is
person . S o I h a d to let go myself. I f h e was goi n g to be sto l e n away from
me, or I was goi ng to lose h i m by accident, I decided it was better to discard
h i m myself. Of course I felt anger that di dn 't fade , that was part of it. B u t
t h e w h o l e th i n g w a s a h uge mistake . It w a s someone I s h o u l d n e v e r h ave
abandoned."
I l isten i n s i l e n c e .
"You w e r e discarded b y t h e one person w h o never should h ave don e
that," M iss S a e k i says . " Kafka - do y o u forgive m e ? "
" D o I have t h e r i g h t to? "
S h e l o oks at my shoulder and nods several ti m e s . "As long as a n g e r a n d
fear don't prevent y o u . "
" M iss Saeki , if I really d o have th e right to , the n y e s - I d o forgive you,"
I tel l her.
Mother, you say. I forgive you. And with those words, audibly, the
frozen part of your heart crumbles.
S i l e n tly, s h e lets go of m e . She takes the hairpin out of h e r h a i r a n d with­
out a moment's hesitation stabs the sharp tip i nto the i n n e r flesh of her left
arm, hard. With her right hand she presses down tightly on a vei n , and blood
begins to seep out. The fi rst drop plops audibly to the floor. With o u t a word
she holds her arm out toward me. Another drop of blood fal l s to the floor.
I bend over and put my l i ps on the small wound, l ick h e r blood with my
tongue , c l ose my eyes, and savor the taste . I hold the blood i n my m outh and
slowly swallow it. H e r blood goes down , deep i n my throat. I t's quietly
absorbed by the dry outer layer of my heart. Only now do I u nderstand how

much I 've wanted that blood. My mind is someplace far away, though my
body is sti l l right here - j ust l ike a l iving spirit. I feel l ike sucking down every
last drop of blood from her, but I can 't. I take my l i p s off h e r arm a n d look
i n to h e r fac e .
" Farewe l l , Kafka Tamura ," M i s s S a e k i says. "Go b a c k t o where you
belong, and l ive."
" M iss Saeki ? " I ask.
"Yes?"
" I don't know what it means to l ive ."
S h e lets m e go and l ooks up at me. She reaches out and touches my l i p s .
" Look at t h e painti ng," she says qui etly. " K e e p l o o k i n g at t h e p a i n t i n g , j ust
l ike I did."
And she leave s . S h e opens the door and, with o u t glancing back, steps
outs i de and closes th e door. I stand at the window and watch her go. Qu ickly
she vanishes i n the shadow of a building. Hands resti ng on th e s i l l , I gaze
for th e l ongest time at where she disappeared. Maybe she forgot to say some­
th i n g and will come back. But she never does. All that's left i s an abse n c e , l ike
a hollow.
The doz i n g bee wakes up and buzzes around me for a wh i l e . Th e n , as if
finally remembering what it's supposed to be doing, it fl i e s out the open win­
dow. The sun s h i nes down . I go back to th e table a n d s i t down. H e r c u p is
s i tting there, with a b i t of tea left i n it. I leave it where i t is, without tOllc h i n g
i t . T h e c u p looks l ike a metaphor. A metaphor of memories that, before long,
will be l ost.
I take off my s h i rt and change back into my sweaty, smelly T-sh i rt. I put
the dead watch back on my left wrist. Then I put th e ball cap Osh i m a gave
m e on backward, and th e pa ir of sky blue sunglasses. F i nally I tug on my
long-sleeved s h i rt. I walk into the kitchen and drink a glass of tap water, put
the glass i n the s i nk, and take a final look around th e roo m . At th e din i n g
tabl e , th e c h a i rs . T h e c h a i r the girl and M iss S a e k i sat o n . The teacup on top
of the tabl e . I close my eyes and take a deep breath .

You already know the

answer to that.
I open th e door, go outside , and close the door. I walk down the porch
steps, my shadow falling disti nct and clear on the ground. I t l ooks l ike i t's
c l i nging to my feet. The sun's still h igh in th e sky.
At the entrance to the forest the two soldiers a re leaning aga i nst a tree
trunk l ike they've been waiting for m e . Wh en th ey see me they don ' t ask a
s i ngle questi on . It's as if th ey al ready know what I ' m th inking. Their rifles are
slung over their shoulders.

The tall soldier is chewing on a stalk of grass. "The entrance is sti l l open,"
he says. "At l east it was when I ch ecked a minute ago."
"You don ' t mind i f we keep the same pace as before ? " the b rawny one
asks. "You can keep up?"
" N o problem. I can keep up."
" I t'll be a prob l e m , though , i f we get there and the entra n c e is already
shut," the tall one comments.
"Then you 're stuck h ere ," his companion adds.
HI know," I say.
" N o regrets at having to leave ? " th e tall one asks.
"Non e."
"Then l e t's get going."
" B e tter not look behind you," th e brawny one says.
"Yeah , that's a good idea," th e tall one says.
And once aga i n I set off through the forest.
Once, as we 're h ur rying up a slope, I do glance back. The soldi ers
warned me not to , but I couldn't help it. Th is is th e last spot you c a n see th e
town from . Beyond it we'll be cut off by a wall of trees, a n d tha t worl d w i l l
vanish from my s i g h t forever.
There sti l l i s n 't a soul on the street. A beauti ful stream run s th rough th e
hollow, small b u i l di n gs l i n e the street, th e electric poles casting dark shadows
on the ground. For a moment I ' m frozen to th e spot. I have to go back, n o
matter what. I c o u l d at least stay there until eveni ng, w h e n the young girl
with the canvas bag will visit me.

If you need me, I'll be there.

I get a hot l u m p

i n my chest a n d a powerful magnet's p u l l i n g m e b a c k toward th e town. M y
feet are b u r i e d i n l e a d a n d won 't budge. If I g o on I ' l l never see her aga i n. I
come to a halt. I 've lost all sense of ti me. I want to call out to the soldi ers in
front of m e ,

I'm not going back, I'm staying.

But no voice comes o u t. Words

have no l i fe i n them.
I ' m caught betwee n one void and another. I h ave n o idea what's right,
what's wrong. I don't even know what I want anymore. I'm standing alone i n
the middle of a h orri fi c sandstorm. I can't move , a n d can't even see my fi n ­
gertips anymore. S a n d as wh ite a s pulverized bones wraps m e i n i ts grip. B u t
I h e a r h er - M iss Saeki - speaking t o m e . " N o matter what, y o u h ave t o go
back," she says decisively. " I t's what I want. For you to be th ere."
The spell is broken , and I'm i n one piece aga i n . Warm blood returns to
my body. The blood she gave me, th e last drops of blood she had. The n ext
instant I ' m facing forward and following the soldi ers. I turn a corn e r and that
little world i n the hills vanishes, swallowed up in dreams. N ow I j ust foc u s o n

making it th rough the forest without getti ng lost. Not wandering from th e
path . That's what's i m portant now, what I have to do .

The entrance is still open. The re's still time until evening. I thank the two
soldiers. They lay down th eir rifles and, l ike before, s i t down on the large flat
rock. The tall soldi er's still chewing on a bit of grass. They're not out of breath
at all after our breathless rush th rough the woods .
" Don't forget w h a t I told y o u about bayonets ," t h e t a l l soldi e r says.
"Wh e n you stab th e enemy, you've got to twist and slash, to cut his guts ope n .
Oth e rwise he'll d o it t o you . That's th e way the world is outs i de . "
"That's not all th ere is, th ough," the brawny one says .
" N o , of course not," th e tall one repl ies, and clears h i s th roat. " I'm j ust
talki n g about th e dark side of th ings."
" I t's also real hard to tell right from wrong," the brawny one says .
" B u t it's someth i n g you've got to do ," th e tall one adds .
" Most l ikely," the brawny one says .
"One more th i ng," the tall one says . "Once you l eave here, don't ever
look back until you reach your desti nati o n . Not even once, do you u n der­
stand?"
"Th is is i m portant," th e brawny one adds .
" Somehow you made it th rough back th ere," th e tal l one says , "but th is
time it's serious. Until you get to where you're going, don't ever look back."
" Ever," the brawny one says .
"I u n derstand," I tell th e m . I thank th em aga i n and say good-bye .
The two of th em come to attention and salute. I'll never see th e m aga i n .
I know that. An d th ey know that. And knowi ng th is, w e say farewe l l .

I don't recall m u c h of h ow I got back t o Oshi ma's cabin a ft e r leavi ng t h e s o l ­
diers. A s I made my w a y th rough th e th ick forest my m i n d m u s t h ave b e e n
elsewhere. Amazi ngly, I didn't g e t lost. I have a vague memory of spotti ng th e
daypack I 'd th rown away and, without th inking, picking it u p . Same w i th th e
compass, the hatchet, the can of spray pai nt. I remember seeing the yellow
marks I 'd sprayed on tree trunks , l ike scales l eft beh i n d by some giant moth .
I stand i n th e clearing i n front o f th e cabin and gaze up a t the sky. The
world around m e is sudde nly filled with brilliant sou nds - bi rds c h i rping,
wate r gurgl ing down the stream , wind rustl ing th e l eaves. Al l fa i n t, but to m e
it's l ike corks h ave b e e n pulled from my ears and n o w eve ryth i n g sounds so

al ive , so warm , so close. Eve ryth i ng's mixed together, but stil l I can make out
each i n dividual sound. I look down at the watch on my wrist, a n d it's work i n g
aga i n . D i gital numbers flash on t h e green screen , c h a n g i n g each m i nute l ike
noth i n g had ever happened. I t's 4:16.
I go i nto th e cabin and l i e down on th e bed in my cloth e s . I ' m exhausted.
I l i e there on my back and close my eyes. A bee is resting above the w i n dow.
The girl 's anns gl isten in th e sunl ight l ike porcel a i n . "An exa m p l e ," she says .
"Look at the painti ng," Miss Saeki says . "Just l ike I did."
Wh ite sands of time slip th rough th e girl 's slim fi ngers . Waves crash softly
aga i nst the shore. They rise up, fal l , and break. Rise up, fal l , and break. And
my consciousness is sucked i nto a di m , da rk corridor.

G

i m m e a break," Hosh ino repeated.
" Noth i ng's about to break here, Mr. Hosh i n o ," the black cat s a i d
wearily. T h e cat had a large face a n d l ooked o l d . " I figured you were

bored all by yourself. Talking to a stone all day."
" B u t h ow can you speak human language ? "
" I can 't."
"I don ' t get it. H ow are we able to carry on a conversati on l ike th is?
A h u m a n and a cat?"
"We 're on th e border of th is world, speaking a common l a n guage .
That's a l l . "
H osh i n o gave th is s o m e th ought. "The border of t h e world? A c o m m o n
l anguage ? "
" I t's a l l right i f y o u don't understand. 1 c o u l d expl a i n , but i t's a l o n g
story," the cat said, giving a couple of short, dismiss ive fl i ps of i ts ta i l .
"Wa i t a sec!" Hoshino said. "You 're Colonel Sanders, aren't you ? "
" C olonel who?" the c a t s a i d sullenly. " I don't know w h o you 're talking
about. I'm m e , and nobody else. Just your friendly neighborhood cat."
"Do you have a name?"
" S ure 1 do ."
"What is it?"
"Toro," the cat repl ied hesitantly.
"Toro ? " Hosh i n o repeated. "Like the real expensive part of tu n a ,
y o u mean?"
" C orrect," the cat repl ied. 'Th e local sushi chef owns m e . They have a
dog, too . They call h i m Tekka .

Tuna Roll."

" D o you know my name, th en?"
"Yo u 're pretty famous, Mr. Hosh in o," Toro repl ied, and smil ed.
Hosh i n o had never seen a cat smile before . The smile qu ickly faded,
th ough , and th e cat went back to its usual docile express i o n .

" C a ts know eve ryth i n g," loro said. "I know that M r. Nakata died yester­
day, and that th ere's a valuable stone over th ere. I 've l ived a l o ng l i fe a n d
know everyth i ng tha t's happened a r o u n d here."
" H m m ," H osh i n o murmu red , impressed. " H ey, instead of us j ust sh oot­
i ng the breeze out here, why don't you come inside , Taro? "
Lyi ng on th e ra i l i ng, t h e c a t shook its head. " N o , I ' m fi n e here. I
wouldn't be able to relax inside. Bes ides, it's a nice day out, so why d o n 't we
j ust talk here?"
"Fine by m e ," Hoshino said. " Say, are you h u ngry? I'm sure we h ave
someth i ng to eat."
Aga i n the cat sh ook h i s h ead. "Thanks, but I ' m all set for food. In fact,
keepi ng my weigh t down 's more of a problem. If your owne r runs a sushi
shop, you ten d to have a bit of a chol esterol problem. Jumpin g u p a n d down 's
not easy when you 're carryi ng some excess pounds."
"We l l , tel l me the n , Taro , is th ere some reason you 're here?"
"There i s ," the black cat said. " I though t you m igh t be having a hard time
deal i ng with that stone all alone."
"You got that righ t. Definitely. I ' m in kind of a bind h e re."
"I tho ugh t I 'd lend you a hand."
''That would be great," Hosh i n o said. "Take a

paws

in you r s c h e d u l e ,

huh?"
"The sto n e 's t h e p roble m ," Taro said, shaking h i s head t o get rid of a
buzzing fly. "Once you get the stone back th e way it belongs , your j ob 's over.
You can go wherever you want after that. Do I have that right?"
"Yu p , you got it. Once I get the stone closed that's all she wrote. Like
M r. Nakata said, once you open someth i ng up you got to close it. That's
the rul e."
"That's why I thought I 'd show you what to do."
"You know what I should do ?" Hoshino asked, excited.
"Of course," the cat said. "What'd I tell you ? C ats know

everything.

Not l ike dogs."
"So what should I do?"
"You h ave to kill it," the cat said soberly.
"Kil l i t?" H osh i n o said.
"That's righ t. You 've got to kill it."
"Wh o is th is

it you 're

talking about?"

"You'll know it when you see it," the black cat explained. " U n ti l you actu­
ally see it, th ough , you won ' t understand what I mean. I t doesn't have any
real form to begi n with. I t changes shape, depending on th e s i tuation."

" I s th is a person we're talking about?"
"No, it's no perso n . That's for certa i n ."
" S o what does it look like?"
"You got me," Toro said. " D i dn't I j ust expla i n ? That you'll know i t when
you see it, and i f you don't you won't? What about that don't you u n de r­
stand?"
Hosh i n o s i ghed. "So what is th is thi ng's real identity?"
"You don't need to know that," the cat said. " I t's hard to expl a i n . Or
maybe I should say you're better off not knowi ng. Anyh ow, right n ow i t's
b i ding its time. Lying in some dark place, breath i n g qui etly, watc h i n g a n d
wa iting. B u t it's not goi ng t o wa it forever. S o o n e r or l a t e r it'll m a k e i ts move .
I'm figuring today is the day. And it will most defini tely pass i n fron t of you .
I t's a n opportu ne moment."
" Opportune?"
"A one-i n-a-mi l l ion chance," th e black cat said. "All you have to do is
wa i t and kill it. That will put an end to it. Th en you're free to go wherever
you l ike."
"Isn't that aga i nst the law?"
"I wouldn't know about the law," Toro said, "being a cat and a l l . S in c e i t's
not a person, th ough , I doubt the law has anyth ing to do with it. Anyhow,
it's got to be kill ed. Even your typical cat next door l ike me can see that."
"Okay, say I want to kill i t - how am I supposed to do it? I don't have any
idea h ow b i g it is or what it looks like. Hard to plan a mu rder when you don't
know the basic facts about the victi m."
" I t's up to you. S mash it with a hammer if you like. Stab i t with a carving
knife . S trangle it. B urn it. B i te it to death . Whatever works for you - but the
m a i n th i n g is you've

got to kill it.

Liqu i date it with extrem e pre j u di c e . You

were in the Self-Defense Force , am I right? Used taxpayers' money to learn
h ow to shoot a rifle? H ow to sharpen a bayonet? You 're a soldier, so use your
head and figure out the best way to kill it."
"What I learned i n the S D F was what to do i n a war," H osh i n o protested
weakly. "They never tra ined me to ambush and kill someth i ng whose s i z e
and s h a p e I don't even know - with a h a m m e r , no less."
" I t'll be trying to get in through the entrance," Toro went o n , ignoring
Hosh i no's protests . " B u t you can't let it - no matter what. You've got to make
sure you kill it before it gets inside the entrance. Got it? Let it s l i p by you , and
that's the end."
"A one-i n-a-million chance."
" Exactly," Toro said. "Though that's j ust a figure of speech ."

" B u t isn't th is th i n g pretty dangerous?" Hosh i n o asked fearfully. " I t might
turn the tables o n me."
" It's proha hly not a l l that dangerous wh en i t's on the move," th e cat s a i d .
"Once i t stops moving, though , watch o u t . That's when i t's dangero us .
S o when i t's o n the move , don't let it ge t away. That's when you 've g o t to
finish it off."

"Probably?" Hosh i n o said.
The black cat didn't reply to that. H e narrowed h i s eye s , stretch e d on the
guardra i l , and slowly got to h i s feet. 'Til be seeing you , M r. Hosh i n o .
Remember t o k i l l i t . If y o u d o n ' t do that, Mr. Nakata will n ever rest i n peace.
You l iked the o l d m a n , didn't you ? "
"Ye a h . H e w a s a good man."
" S o you 've got to k i l l it. Liqu idate it with extrem e pre j udice, a s I sa i d . M r.
Nakata would 've wanted you to . So do it for h i m . You 've taken on h i s rol e
now. You 've a lways b e e n a happy-go-l ucky type , n ever taking responsibil ity
for anyth ing, right? N ow's the chance to make up for that. D o n ' t blow it,
okay? I'll be rooti ng for you."
"That's encouragi ng," Hoshino said. "Oh , hey - I j ust thought of something."
"What?"
" Maybe th e entrance stone is still open to l u re i t i n ? "
" C o u l d b e ," Toro said diffidently. " O n e more th ing. I t only m a k e s a m ove
very late at night. S o you should sleep during the day to make sure you don't
fal l asleep late and let i t get away. That would be a catastroph e ."
The black cat leaped ni mbly onto the roof next door, stra i ghtened h i s
ta i l , and walked away. For s u c h a h uge c a t h e was l ight on h i s feet. Hosh i n o
watched fro m t h e veranda as t h e c a t disappeared . Toro didn't l o o k hack even
once.
"Man al ive," Hoshino said, then went back into the kitc h e n to scout
around for potential weapons. He found an extremely sharp kitc h e n knife ,
plus a nother heavy knife shaped l ike a hatchet. The kitc h e n h a d only a rudi­
mentary assortment of pots and pans, but quite a collection of knive s . I n addi­
tion h e selected a large, hefty hammer and some nyl o n rop e . An i c e pick
rou nded out his arsenal .
Here 's where a nice automatic ri fle would come i n handy, he thought as
he rum maged around the kitc h e n . H e had been tra i ned to shoot a u tomatic
rifles i n the S D F, and was a decent marksman. Not that h e expected to fi n d a
rifl e in a cupboard somewhere . If anybody ever shot off an automatic ri fl e i n
a qu iet neighborhood l ike th i s , there 'd b e hell t o pay.

He l a i d all h i s weapons down on the l iving-room table - th e two knives,
ice pick, hammer, and rope. He put a flashl ight beside th e m , then sat down
next to the stone and began rubb ing it.
"Jeez," Hoshino said to the stone. "A hammer a n d knives to fight some­
th ing, and I don ' t even know what it is? With a black cat from the neighbor­
hood calling the shots? What th e hell kind of deal is

this?"

Th e stone, of cours e , withheld comment.
"Taro said it probably wasn't dangerous.

Park spri ngs u p ? What the h e l l am I supposed t o d o the n , h u h ?

I 'd be a goner."
No response.
Hoshino grabbed the hammer and swung it around a few times.
" I f you th ink about it, it's all fate . From the time I p icked up Mr. Nakata
at the rest area till now, it's l ike fate decided everyth ing. The only one who
hasn't had a clue has been

me.

Fate is one strange th i ng, m a n ," Hos h i n o said.

" Right? What's your take on it?"
The stone m a i ntained its stony silence.
"Well, what can you do , right? I ' m the one who chose th is path , and I 've
got to see it through to the end. Kind of hard to imagine what repulsive
th i ng's gonna pop out - but I'm okay with that. Got to give it my best shot.
Life's sh ort, and I 've had some good times. Taro said th i s is a one-i n-a-mi l l i o n
c h a n c e . Maybe it wouldn ' t be so b a d t o g o out i n a b l a z e of glory. A t l e a s t try
to w i n one for the old guy. For Mr. Nakata."
Th e stone's silent vigil continued.
Hoshino did as the cat had told him and took a nap on the sofa in prepa­
ration for the night. It felt strange to follow a cat's i nstructi ons, but once he
did lie down h e was able to sleep soundly for an hour. I n the evening he
went i nto the kitc h e n , defrosted some shrimp cu rry, and had it over r i c e . As
it started to get dark, he sat down next to the sto n e , knives and h a m m e r i n
easy reach .
H e turned off a l l the l i ghts except for a small table l a m p . That's best, h e
figured. It only makes a move a t night, he thought, so I might a s well make i t
as dark as possible . I want t o w i n d th is up soon, too - so i f you 're out th ere,
show your face! Let's get it over with , okay? Once we're finished h e re I ' m
goi n g back t o Nagoya , t o m y apartment, a n d call up some girl a n d g e t i t o n .
H e no longer talked t o the stone . He j ust waited there silently, gl ancing
every so often at the clock. When he got bored h e 'd swing the knife and h a m ­
mer around. I f anyth ing happens, he thought, it's got to be the middl e of the
night. Though of course it might take place before that, a n d h e wanted to

.po

make sure he didn't m i ss h i s chance - h is one-i n-a-m i l l i o n c ha nc e . Now
wasn't the ti m e to slack off. Every once in a wh ile h e took a b i te of cracker
and a sip of m i n e ral water.
" H ey, sto n e ," H o s h i n o whispered . " I t's past midnight n ow - th e time the
demons come out. The moment of truth . Let's you and me find out what's
gonna happe n , what d 'ya say?" He reached out to touch the sto n e . M aybe i t
w a s j ust h i s i m agination, b u t t h e surface seemed s l ightly w a r m e r tha n usual .
He rubbed it over and over, to buck up h i s courage . " I want you to root for
me too , okay?" he said to the stone. "I could do with a l i ttle emotional sup­
port here."

I t was a l i ttle after three a.m. when a fa int rustl i ng noise started to come from
the room where Nakata's body lay. A sound l ike someth i ng c rawl i ng a l o ng
tata m i . B u t there weren't any tatami , because that room was carpete d .
Hosh i n o looked u p and l i stened closely. No mi stake a b o u t it, h e thought,
I don't know what it i s , but someth i ng's happening i n there . His h e a rt started
to pound. He stuck the hammer in his belt, grabbed the sharpest knife in h i s
right h a n d , t h e fl a s h l ight in h i s left, a n d stood u p .
" H ere w e go . . . , " he s a i d t o no o n e i n particular.
H e c rept s i l e ntly to th e door to Nakata's room and opened it. He
switched on the flashl ight and played it qui ckly around the body. That's defi­
nitely where the rustl i ng had come from . The beam i l l u m inated a l o ng, pale ,
th i n object that was squ i rm i ng o u t of Nakata 's mouth . T h e o b j e c t reminded
Hoshino of a gourd . I t was as th ick as a man's arm , and tho ugh h e couldn't
tel l h ow l o ng i t was , Hosh i n o guessed that about half of i t was out. I ts wet
body gl istened l ike mucus. Nakata's mouth was stretched wide open l ike a
snake's, to let the th i ng out. H i s j aw must have been u n h i nge d , it was so
wide open.
Hoshino gulped l oudly. H is hand holdi ng th e flashlight was tre m b l i ng a
l ittl e , the l igh t wavering. Jeez, now h ow am I supposed to k i l l th is th i ng? h e
wondere d . I t didn't s e e m t o have a n y arms or l egs , eyes or n o s e . S o s l i my you
can't even get a good grip. So how a m I supposed to liquidate it? And what the
hell kind of c reature

is

it, anyway?

Was it a kind of parasite that had been h i di ng inside Nakata all th is t i m e ?
Or w a s it t h e old man's soul? No, that c a n ' t be it. H i s i n tu ition t o l d h i m that
kind of creepy th i ng couldn't have been inside Nakata. Even

I

know that

muc h . I t had to come from somewhere else, and it's go i ng through M r.
Nakata j ust to get inside the entrance. It showed up when it wanted to , u s i ng

Mr. N akata as a kind of passageway for its own purposes. And I c a n ' t let
that happen . That's why I 've got to kill it. Like the cat said,

liquidate it with

extreme prejudice.
Hosh i n o went over to Nakata and quickly stabbed h i s knife i n to what
seemed to be the head of th e th ing. He pulled out th e knife and stabbed
aga i n , over and over. But there was l i ttle resistance to the knife , j ust the crisp
feel you get when you plunge a knife into a soft vegetabl e . B e low the slimy
exterior there was no flesh , no bones. No organs, n o bra i n . Once h e pulled
th e blade out, th e mucus covered up the wound right away. No blood or
l i quid oozed out. It doesn't feel a th ing, Hosh i n o thought. No matter h ow
fiercely he attacked it, the th ing kept on creeping out of Nakata's m o u th ,
nonplussed.
H o s h i n o tossed the knife to th e floor and went back to th e living room
a n d pi cked up th e heavy hatchet-shaped knife . H e swu ng it down on the
white th ing over and over, splitting the head ope n , but j ust as he th ought,
the re was noth i ng ins ide -j ust th e same mushy wh ite as th e oute r ski n . He
slashed at i t a few times, finally severing part of th e head, which squirmed l ike
a slug o n the floor for a moment, th en stopped movi ng l ike it was dead. This
had no effect on the rest of th e body, wh ich continued to ooze forward.
Mucus soon covered up the wound, swelling up so th e th i n g l ooked th e s a m e
as before. None of th is slowed it down as it wiggled o n out of th e old m a n 's
mouth .
F i nally, the whole object was out, reveal i ng its entire form . The creature
was about a yard long, with a ta il, wh ich finally allowed Hosh ino to figure out
for sure wh ich end was wh ich. The tail was l ike a salamander's, short and
th ick, the tip abruptly tapering down to a th in point. It had no legs, no eyes, no
mouth or nose. But it most definitely had a will of i ts own . No, Hosh ino
thought, it's more l ike a will is

all

it has. He didn 't need to figure that out logi­

cally, he j ust knew it. Wh en it's on the move , he thought, it j ust happens to take
on th is shape. A chill ran lip his spine. Anyway, he concl uded, I 've got to kill it.
He tried the hammer next, but it didn 't do any good. H e 'd pound one
part of the creatu re only to see th e surrounding flesh and mucus fi l l in th e
depressi o n h e 'd made . He carried over a small table and started bash i n g th e
th i n g with one of the legs , but nothing slowed down i ts i nexorabl e adva n c e .
L i k e s o m e clu msy snake it slowly, steadily crawl ed toward th e n ext r o o m and
th e e ntrance sto n e .
Th is isn't l ike a n y other l iving creature I 've ever seen, Hosh i n o thought.
No weapon has any effect on it. There 's no heart you can stab, no th roat you
can th rottl e . So what th e hell can I do? Th is th ing is

evil,

and n o matter what

I 've got to keep it from getting into the entrance. Toro said I 'd know it when
I saw it, and dam n i f h e isn't right. I can't let th i s th i n g l ive.
Hoshino went back to the kitchen to look for someth i ng else to use as a
weapon, but couldn't fi n d a nyth ing. Suddenly he l ooked down at the stone at
h i s feet. The entrance stone. That's it! I can use the stone to smash the th i ng.
In the dim l ight the stone had a more reddish cast to it tha n usual. He bent
down and tri e d to l i ft it. It was terribly heavy, and h e couldn't budge it a n
inch. " I see - you 're b a c k t o b e i n g th e entrance sto n e ," he s a i d. " S o i f I c l o s e
y o u u p before t h a t th i n g gets h e r e , it won't be a b l e t o go i n s i de . "
Hosh i n o struggl ed with all h i s might t o l i ft t h e stone, but c o u l dn 't.
"You 're not moving," he said to the stone, gu lping down big breaths.
"I th ink you 're even heavier than before. You 're a real ballbuster, you know
that?"
B e h i n d h i m the rustl ing sound continued. The white th i n g was steadily
getti ng c l oser a n d closer. H e di dn 't have much time.
"One more try," Hoshino said. H e rested h i s hands o n the sto n e , took a
huge breath , fi l l i ng h i s l u ngs, and held the a i r i n . He focused a l l h i s e ne rgy
on one spot a n d put both hands on one side of th e stone. If he couldn't l ift i t
th i s time, h e wouldn't have a s e c o n d c h a n c e .

This is it, Hashina!

N ow o r

never. I ' m g o n n a d o th is if it kills me! With all t h e strength h e c o u l d muster
he gave a groan and l i fted. The stone ra ised up s lightly. H e put his last o u n c e
of energy i nto it and m anaged - l ike he w a s stripping th e sto n e off the floor­
to l i ft it up.
His head fel t fa i n t and the muscles in h i s arms were scream i n g with p a i n .
H i s b a l l s felt l ike they'd long since b e e n busted. Sti l l , h e c o ul dn ' t r a i s e i t a n y
h i gher. Hosh i n o thought of Nakata, h o w t h e old man had g i v e n h i s l i fe to
open and close the stone. Somehow, some way, he had to see it through to
the b i tter end. Toro told h i m he had to take ove r from the old m a n . H i s mus­
cles were aching for fresh blood, h i s l ungs dying for air to m ake that blood,
but he couldn't breathe. He knew he was about as close to death as you
can get, the abyss of noth i ngness gaping open right before his eyes. But he
ignored th i s , focused all his strength one last time, and pulled the stone
towa rd him. I t l ifted up and, with a massive th ud, fl i pped over a n d fel l to the
floor. The floor shook with the shock, the glass door rattl i ng. The sto n e was
tremendously, profoundly heavy.
Hoshino sat th ere gasping for a i r. "You did good," he tol d h i mself a few
moments later, once he finally caught h i s breath.

O n c e h e 'd closed th e entrance, taking care of the wh i te o b j e c t was s u rpris­
i ngly si mple. It was shut out of where it was headed, and it knew it. It stopped
its forward adva nce and started crawl ing around the room looking for a place
to h i de , perhaps hoping to crawl back inside Nakata's mouth . B u t i t di dn't
have th e strength to escape. Hoshino went right after it, chopping i t to pieces
with h i s cleaver. Those pi eces he chopped into even tinier ones. These l i ttle
b i ts writhed for a wh i l e on the floor, but soon lost stren gth and stopped m ov­
i n g. Th ey curled up into tight l i ttle balls and di ed, th e carpet gl iste n i n g with
the i r s l i m e . Hoshino gathered all the pieces with a dustpan, du mped the m i n
a garbage bag that h e tied closed with string, th en p u t th is b a g i n s i de another
that he also tied u p tight. Th is he put inside a th ick cloth bag h e fou n d in
the closet.
C o mpletely dra ined, he squatted on the floor, h is shoulde rs heaving as
h e took deep breaths. H i s hands were shaking. H e wanted to say someth i ng,
but couldn't form th e words. "You did a good j o b , H osh i n o ," h e managed to
say a few moments later.
With all the noise h e 'd made attacking that white c reature and fl ipping
the stone ove r, h e was worried that people in the apartment b u i l di n g had
woken u p and were even now dia l i ng 9 1 1 . Fortunately, noth i ng happened. No
police s i rens, no one pounding on the door. The last th ing he needed was for
the police to come barging in.
Hosh i n o knew th e bits and pieces of the wh ite th i n g stuffed tightly i n the
bags weren't about to come back to l i fe. There's n o place l eft for the m to
go, he thought. But it was a good idea j ust to make sure, so he dec i ded that
as soon as it was l ight h e 'd go to the beach and burn the m all up. Turn the m
into ash.
And once that was over he'd head back to Nagoya. Back home.

I t was nearly four by th is time, and getting l ight out. Ti m e to get going.
Hoshino stuffed his cl othes i nto his bag, includi n g - j ust to be o n the safe
s i de-h i s sunglasses and C h u n i c h i Dragons ball cap. Getti n g snagged by the
pol ice before h e could finish would mess up the whole th i ng. He took along
a bottle of cooking oil to use to l ight the fire. H e remembered h is CD of the

Archduke Tri o and tossed it i n

h i s bag as well.

F i n al ly, he went into the room where Nakata lay in bed. The AC was still
on full blast, and the room was freezi ng. " H ey there, M r. Nakata," h e said,
''I 'm about ready to take off. Sorry, but I can't stay here forever. I 'l l call the
cops from the station so they can come take care of your body. We ' l l j ust h ave

to l eave th e rest up to some kind patrol men, okay? We 'll never see each oth e r
aga i n , but I ' l l n ever forget you . Even if I tried to , I don't th ink I c o u l d . "
With a loud rattle the a i r conditioner shut off.
"You know what, Gramps?" he went on. "I th ink that wh e n ever some­
th ing happens i n the future I ' l l always wonder - What

about this? What would Mr. Nakata do?

would Mr. Nakata say

I ' l l always h ave someone I c a n tu rn

to . And that's kind of a big deal , if you th ink about i t. I t's l ike part of you w i l l
always l ive i n s i d e m e . Not that I ' m the b e s t conta i n e r y o u could fi n d , but bet­
te r than noth i ng, h u h ? "
B u t t h e person h e w a s address ing was noth i ng more tha n a s h e l l of
Mr. Nakata . The most i mportant part of him had long since left for anoth e r
place. A n d H o s h i n o understood th i s .
" H ey there," h e said t o the stone, and reached out t o tou c h i ts s u rfac e . I t
w a s b a c k t o being j ust a n ordinary stone, c o o l and rough t o t h e tou c h . " I' m
heading o u t . G o i n g b a c k home t o Nagoya . I ' l l have t o let th e c o p s take c a r e of
you too . I know I should take you back to the shrine where you came fro m ,
b u t my m e mory i s n ' t so good a n d I don't have a n y i d e a w h i c h s h r i n e i t i s .
You ' l l h a v e t o forgive m e . D o n ' t put a curse on m e or anyth ing, okay? I o n l y
did what C o l o n e l Sanders tol d me to . So if you 're g o n n a put a c urse o n a ny­
body, h e 's you r guy. Anyhow, I ' m happy I could meet you . I 'l l never forget
you, eith e r."
Hosh i n o put o n h i s th i ck-soled N ike sneakers and walked o u t of the
apartment, leaving the door unlocked. In one hand he h e l d h i s bag with a l l
h i s th ings, i n the oth e r the b a g with that white

thing's

corpse.

"Gentl e m e n ," h e said, gaz ing up at the dawn rising i n the east, " i t's time
to l ight my fi re!"

Chapter 49

J

ust after n i n e the next morning, I hear th e sound of a car approa c h i n g
and go outs i de . It's a s m a l l four-wh eel-drive Datsun tru ck, the k i n d with
mass ive tires and the body j acked up high. It l ooks l ike it hasn't been

washed i n at least a half a year. In the bed are two long, well-used s urfboards .
The truck gri nds to a stop in front of the cab i n . Whe n th e engine c u ts off
silence returns. The door opens and a tall young man cl imbs out, wearing an
overs ize white T-sh i rt, an oil-sta ined No Fear s h i rt, khaki shorts , and s neakers
that have seen better days . Th e guy looks around th i rty, with wide shoulders.
H e 's tanned all over and has th ree days ' worth of stubble on h i s fac e . H i s
h a i r's l o n g enough to h i de h i s ears. I ' m guess ing th is must be Osh i m a 's older
brother, the one who runs a surf shop i n Koc h i .
" H ey," h e says .
" Morni ng," I reply.
H e sticks out his h and, and we shake hands on the porc h . He has a stron g
gri p . I guessed right. H e does tu rn out t o be Osh i m a 's older brother.
" Everybody calls me Sada ," he tells me. H e talks slowly, choosing his
words deliberately, l ike he's in no h ur ry. Like he has all the ti me i n the world.
"I got a call from Takamatsu to come pick you up and take you back," he
expl a i n s . " Sounds l ike some urgent busi ness came up . "
" U rgent business?"
"Yeah . I don ' t know what, though ."
" S orry you had to go to all th is trouble," I tel l h i m .
" N o need to apologize," he says . "Can you get ready to l eave soon? "
"G ive me five mi nutes."
Wh i l e I ' m stuffi ng my th ings in my backpack, h e helps m e close up the
place, whistl i n g all the wh i l e . He shuts th e window, pulls th e c ur ta i n s , checks
that th e gas is off, gath ers lip the remaining food, does a qu ick scrub of the
sink. I can tel l from watching h i m that he feels l ike th e cab i n 's an exte n s i o n
of h i mself.

"Seems l ike my brother l ikes you," Sada says . "He doesn't l ike a l l that
many peopl e . H e 's sort of a difficult person."
"He's been really kind to m e . "
Sada nods . "He can be pretty nice wh e n h e wants t o be."
I c l i m b i n to the passenger seat of the truck and toss my backpack at
my feet.
Sada turns o n the igniti o n , shifts into gear, leans out the window to check
out the cabin o n e more time, then steps on the gas . "Th is cabin is one of th e
few th ings the two of us share as brothers," he says as he expertly mane uvers
down the mountain road. "When the mood h i ts us, we someti mes come h e re
and spend a few days alone." He mulls th is over for a wh i l e , th e n goes o n .
"Th is w a s always a n i m portant place for the two of u s , a n d stil l i s . I t's l ike
there 's a power here that recharges us. A quiet sort of power. You know what
I mean?"
"I th ink s o ," I tel l h i m .
"My broth e r s a i d you would," Sada says . "People that don't g e t i t
never w i l l ."
Th e faded c l oth seats are covered with white dog h a i r. The dog s m e l l
mixes with t h a t of t h e sea, plus t h e s c e n t of sur fboard w a x a n d ciga rettes. T h e
knob for t h e A C is broken off. T h e ashtray's ful l of butts , t h e s i de pocket
stuffed ful l of random cassette tapes, mi nus th eir boxes.
"I went i n to the woods a few times," I say.
"Deep in there ? "
"Ye s ," I reply. "Osh ima warned me n o t to."
"But you went i n a nyway."
"Yeah," I say.
"I did the same once. Must be l ike ten years ago." H e 's s i l e n t for a time,
concentrati ng o n h i s driving. We 're on a long c u rve, the th ick tires sprayi n g
pebbles as we go. Eve ry so often there 're crows beside th e road. T h e y don't try
to fly away, j ust watch inte ntly, with curious eyes, as we pass by.
"D i d you run across the soldiers ? " Sada asks as casually as if h e 'd asked
me what time i t was .
"You mean those two soldiers?"
"Right," Sada responds, glancing at me. "You went i n that far, h u h ? "
"Ye a h , I did," I reply.
His hands l i ghtl y gri pping th e wh eel as he maneuvers it, he doesn't
respond, and h i s express ion doesn't tel l me anyth ing.
"Sada ? " I ask.
"H m ? " h e says .

"Wh e n you met those soldi ers ten years ago, what did you d o ? "
"What did I do w h e n I m e t those soldiers?" he repeats .
I n o d and wa i t for h i s answer.
H e glances i n the rearview mirror, th en looks in front aga i n . ' ' I 've never
talked about that to a nyone," he says . "Not even to my brother. B rother,
siste r - whatever you want to call him. B roth er works for m e . H e doesn't
know a nyth ing about th ose soldiers."
I nod s i l ently.
"And I doubt I ' l l ever tell anybody about it. Even you . And I don't th ink
you'll ever talk about it to anyone, either. Even to m e . You know what I ' m
trying t o say? "
" I th ink so," I tell h i m .
"What i s it?"
" It's not someth ing you can get across i n word s . The real response i s
someth i n g words c a n ' t express ."
"There you go," Sada repl ies. " Exactly. If you can't get it across i n words
th e n it's better not to try."
" Even to yourself? " I ask.
"Ye a h , even to yourself," Sada says . " Better not to try to expla i n it, even to
yourself."
H e offers me a stick of Cool M i nt gu m . I take one and start chewing.
"You ever try surfing?" he asks.
"No."
" I f y o u h a v e the c h a n c e I ' l l teach you ," h e says . " I f you'd l ike t o l earn , I
m e a n . The waves are pretty decent along th e Koc h i shore, and there aren't
so many surfers. S u rfing's a more profound kind of sport than it looks. Wh e n
y o u surf y o u learn not t o fi g h t t h e power of nature, e v e n i f i t gets violent."
H e takes out a cigarette from the pocket of his T-s h i rt, sticks i t i n h i s
mouth , and l ights it up with the dashboard l ighter. "That's a n oth er th i n g that
words can't expl a i n . One of th ose th ings that's neither a yes or a n o answer."
H e narrows his eyes and blows smoke out the window. "In H awa i i ," h e goes
on, "there 's a spot they call the Toilet B owl . The re 're these h uge w h i rlpools
because i t's where the i ncoming and outgoing tides meet and crash i n to each
other. I t goes around and around l ike when you flush a toilet. I f you wipe out
th ere, you get pulled underwater and it's hard to float u p aga i n . Depending
o n the waves you might never make it back to the surfa c e . So there you are,
underwater, pounded by waves, and there's noth i ng you can d o . Fla i l i ng
around's not gonna get you anywh ere. You'll j ust use up your ene rgy. You 've
n ever been so scared in your l i fe . But unless you get over that fear you ' l l never

be a real surfer. You h ave to face death , get to really know it, th e n overc o m e
it. Wh en you 're down i n t h a t wh i rlpool y o u start th inking a b o u t a l l k i n d s
of th i ngs . It's l ike y o u get t o be friends with death , h a v e a heart-to-heart talk
with it."
At the gate h e gets out of the truck and locks it back u p , j iggl i ng the c h a i n
a c o u p l e of times t o make sure i t ' l l h o l d .
After th is we d o n ' t t a l k m u c h . H e leaves an FM stati o n on as h e drives,
but I can tel l h e 's not really l istening to it. Having the radio o n 's j ust a token
gesture. Even when we go into a tu nnel and all we hear is stati c , h e doesn't
m i n d . With the AC broke n , we leave the windows open when we get o n the
h ighway.
"If you ever feel l ike learning how to surf, stop by and see m e ," Sada says
as the I n l a n d Sea comes into vi ew. "I have an extra room , and you can stay as
long as you l ike."
''Thanks ,'' I say. ' ' I ' l l take you up on that. I don't know when, though ."
"You pretty busy?"
" I have a couple of th i ngs I have to take care of."
" Same with me," Sad a says .
We don't say anyth i ng for a long time. H e 's th inking over h i s probl e m s ,
I ' m th inking over m i n e . He keeps h i s eyes on t h e road , left hand o n t o p of the
steering wh e e l , and smokes an occasional c iga rette . U n l ike Osh i m a , he
doesn't speed . With his elbow propped on the open window, h e drives down
the h ighway at a leisurely pace. The only time h e passes oth e r c a rs i s when
they're go i ng way too slow. Th en h e reluctantly steps o n the gas, goes
a ro u n d , th e n s l i ps right back i nto h i s lane.
" H ave you been surfing for a long time?" I ask h i m .
" H m m ," h e says, a n d th en th ere's silence. Finally, when I 've a l m ost for­
gotten the questio n , he answers .
'Tve been surfing since h igh school . Then it was j ust for fu n . D i d n 't
really get serious about it till six years ago . I was work i ng at a b ig ad agency i n
Tokyo . I couldn't stand it so I quit, moved back here, a n d started surfing. I
took out a l oa n , borrowed some money from my folks , a n d opened a s u rf
shop. I ru n it a l o n e , so I can pretty much do whatever I want."
"Did you want to come back to S h i koku ? "
"That w a s part of it," h e says. " I d o n ' t know, I d o n ' t fee l righ t u n less I 've
got the sea and mountains nearby. People are mostly a product of where they
were born and ra ised. H ow you th ink and fee l 's always l i nked to the lay of th e
land, the temperature . The preva i l i ng winds, eve n . Where were you b o rn ? "
"Tokyo . I n Nogata , i n Nakano Ward ."

" D o you want to go back there?"
I shake my head. "No."
"Why not?"
"There's no reason for me to go back."
"Okay," h e says .
'Tm not very connected to the lay of the land, the preva i l i ng winds and
all that," I say.
"Yeah?" he says .
We 're silent aga i n . S i l ence doesn't seem to both e r h i m a bit. Or m e
either. I j ust sit th ere, my m i n d a blank, l i stening t o th e music on t h e radi o .
H e 's staring a t the road stra ight ahead. Eventually w e exit the h i gh way, tu rn
north , and come into the Takamatsu city l i mits .

I t's a l i ttle before o n e p . m . when w e arrive at th e Komura Libra ry. Sada drops
m e off i n front but doesn't get out h i mself. The engine's stil l on, and h e 's
heading right back to Koc h i .
"Thanks," I say.
" H ope we can see each oth er soon," he says . H e sticks h i s hand out the
window, gives a short wave , then peels out on his th ick tires . Heading back to
catch some big waves, to h i s own worl d , h i s own issues .
I put on my backpack and pass through the gate . I catch a wh iff of the
freshly m own l awn i n the garde n . It feels l ike I 've been away for month s , but
it's only been fou r days .
Osh i m a 's at the counter, wearing a tie, someth i n g I 've n ever seen before .
A wh ite button-down s h i rt, and a mustard-yel l ow-and-green-striped ti e . H e 's
rolled the sleeves up to h i s elbows and does n · t have a jacket o n . I n front of
h i m , predictably, there's a coffee cup and two neatly sharpened p e n c i l s .
" H ey," h e greets m e , adding h i s u s u a l s m i l e .
" H i ," I s a y back.
"Guess you caught a ride with my brother?"
"That's right."
" B e t he didn't talk much," Osh ima says .
"Actual ly, we did talk a l ittle."
"You 're l ucky. Depending on who he's with , sometimes h e won 't say
a word ."
"Did someth ing happen here?" I ask. "He told me there was someth i n g
urgent."

Osh ima nods. "There are a couple of th i ngs you need to know about.
First of all, M iss Saeki passed away. She had a heart attack. I fou n d her col­
lapsed facedown on her desk upsta i rs on Tu esday aftern o o n . I t happened all
of a sudden, and it doesn't seem l ike she suffered ."
I set my pack on the floor and sit down i n a c h a i r. "Tuesday aftern o o n ? "
I a s k . "Today's Friday, right?"
"Yes, that's right. She died after the regu lar Tu esday tour. I probably
should 've gotten i n touch with you sooner, but I couldn't th i n k stra ight."
Sunk back i n th e chair, I find I can't move . The two of us s i t th ere in
silence for a long ti m e . I can see the sta i rs leading to th e second floor, the
well-polished black bani ster, the stained glass on the landing. Those sta i rs
always h e l d a special significance for me, because they l e d to h e r , to M iss
Saek i . B u t now they're j ust e mpty stairs, with no meaning at all. S h e 's no
longer there .
"As I mentioned before, I th ink th is was all predesti ned," O s h i m a says .
" I knew it, a n d so did s h e . Though when it actually happens, of course, i t's
pretty hard to take ."
Wh en h e pauses, I feel l ike I should say someth i ng, but th e words
won't c o m e .
"According t o her w i s h e s , there w o n ' t be a fu neral ," Osh i m a continues.
" S h e was qui etly cremated. S h e left a will in a drawer i n h e r desk u psta irs.
She left h e r e ntire estate to th e foundation that ru ns the l i b ra ry. S h e left me
her Mont Blanc pen as a keepsake . And a painting for you . The o n e of the
boy on the shore . You ' l l take it, won't you?"
I nod.
" I t's all wrapped up over th ere, ready to go."
"Thanks," I say, finally able to speak.
"Tell me someth i ng, Kafka Tamura ," Oshima says . H e p icks u p a pencil
and gives it his usual twi rl . " I s it okay if I a s k y o u a questi o n ? "
I nod.
" I didn't need t o t e l l y o u she d i e d , d i d I ? You already knew."
Aga i n I nod . "I th ink I did."
" I th ought s o ," Osh ima says, and draws a deep breath . "Wo u l d you l ike
some water or someth ing? To tell you the truth , you look as parched as a desert."
"Thanks, I could use some." I a m pretty th i rsty, but hadn't realized it
until h e mentioned it.
I down the i c e water he bri ngs me in a si ngle gulp, so fast my head starts
to ache. I put th e empty glass back on the tabl e .
" C are for s o m e more?"

4 31

I shake my head.
"What are your plans now?" Oshima asks .
" I ' m going to go back to Tokyo ," I reply.
"What are you going to do th ere?"
"Go to the pol i c e , fi rst of a l l , and tel l th e m what I know. If I don 't, they'll
be after m e th e rest of my l i fe . And then I'll most l ikely go back to schoo! .
Not that I want to, but I have to at least finish j u nior h igh . I f I j ust put up with
it for a few months and graduate , then I can do whatever I want."
" Makes sense," Osh ima says . He na rrows his eyes and l ooks at me. "That
sounds l ike the best plan ."
"Mo re and more I 've been th inking that's the way to go."
"You can run but you can't hide?"
"Yeah , I guess so," I say.
"You 've grown up."
I shake my head. I can't say a th ing.
Oshima l i ghtly taps the eraser end of a pencil aga inst his temple a couple
of times. The phone rings, but he ignores it.
" Every one of us is losing someth ing precious to u s ," h e says after the
phone stops ringing. " Lost opportunities, lost poss i b i l i ti e s , fee l ings we c a n
n e v e r g e t b a c k aga i n . That's part of w h a t it means t o be alive. B u t i n s i d e o u r
heads - at l e a s t that's where I imagine i t - there's a l i ttle r o o m where we store
those memories. A room l ike the stacks in th is l ibra ry. And to understand the
workings of our own heart we have to keep on making new reference cards.
We have to dust th ings off every once in a wh i l e , let i n fresh air, change
the water i n the fl ower vases. In other words, you 'll l ive foreve r i n your own
private l i b ra ry."
I stare at the pencil in his hand. It pains me to look at it, but I have to be
the worl d 's toughest fifteen-year-old, at least for a wh i l e longer. Or pretend to
b e . I take a deep breath , fill my lu ngs with a i r , and manage to inhale that
lump of emoti o n . " I s it all right if I come back here someday?" I ask.
"Of course ," Osh i m a says , and lays h i s pencil back on the counter. He
l i nks his hands behind h i s head and looks stra ight at me. "Th e word i s that I 'll
be i n charge of the library for a wh i l e . And I imagine I ' l l need a n assistant.
Once you 're free of the pol ice, school, what h ave you - an d provided you
want to , of course - I 'd love to have you back. The town and I aren't going
a nywhere, not for the time being. People need a place they can belong."
''Tha nks ,'' I tel l h i m .
"You 're quite wel c o m e ," he says .
"Your broth e r said he'd teach me how to surf."

"That's great. He doesn't take to most peopl e ," he says . " H e 's a b i t of a dif­
ficult person . "
I nod, and s m i l e . They really are quite al ike, these two brothers.
" Kafka," Oshima says, looking deep into my eyes. " I could be wrong, but
I think that's the first time I 've ever seen you smile."
"You could be right," I say. I most definitely a m s m i l i n g . And blushing.
"Wh e n are you going back to Tokyo? "
" Right now, I th ink."
" C a n ' t you wa it till evening? I can drive you to th e station after we
close up."
I consider th i s , then shake my head. "Thanks. But I th ink it's best if I
leave right away."
Oshima nods. He goes into a back room and bri ngs out the n eatly
wrapped painting. H e also puts a s i ngle copy of the record " Kafka o n the
Shore" in a bag and hands i t to me. "A l i ttle present fro m m e . "
"Thanks," I say. " I s it okay if I g o up and see M i ss Saeki's r o o m one
more time?"
"Go right ahead."
"Would you come with m e ? "
"Of course ."
We go upsta i rs to her roo m . I stand i n front of her desk, l ightly tou c h i ts
surface, a n d th i n k over all the th i ngs it has absorbed. I p i cture h e r slu mped
facedown on the desk. H ow she always sat there , th e window behind her,
busily writing away. H ow I brought her coffe e , when s he 'd glance up as
I opened th e door and came in s ide . H ow she always smiled at m e .
"What w a s it s h e was writing here ? " I ask.
" I don't know," Osh i m a repl ie s . "One th ing I

do know for s u re

i s she took

a lot of secrets with h e r when she left th is worl d . "
A lot of theories as wel l , I s i lently th ink.
The window's open, the June breeze gently rustl i n g th e h e m of the w hi te
lace c u rta i n s . A fa int scent of the sea is in the a i r. I remember fee l i n g the sand
i n my hand at the beach . I walk away from the desk and over to Osh i m a , a n d
hold h i m tight. H i s s l i m b o d y calls up all sorts of nostalgic m e m o r i e s .
H e gently r u b s my h a i r. "The world is a metaphor, Kafka Ta mura ," h e
says into my e a r . " B u t for y o u a n d me th is l ibrary a l o n e is n o m etaphor.
I t's always j ust th is l ibra ry. I want to make sure we understand that."
"Of course ," I say.
" I t's a unique, special l i b ra ry. And noth i n g else can ever take its place."
I no d.

4 33

" G ood-bye , Kafka ," Osh ima says .
"Good-bye , Osh im a," I say. "You know, you look good in that n e cktie . "
H e l ets g o of m e , looks me i n the fac e , a n d s m i l e s . ''I 've b e e n waiting for
you to say that."

Shouldering my backpack, I walk to the local station and take the tra i n back
to Takamatsu Station . I buy a ticket to Tokyo at the cou nter. The tra i n will get
i n to Tokyo late at night, so the first th ing I'll have to do is find a place to stay
for th e night, th en head over to my house i n Nogata the n ext day. I ' l l be a l l
alone i n that h u g e , vacant h o u s e . Nobody's waiting for me t o come h o m e .
B u t I have n o other p l a c e t o g o back to .
I use a public phone at the station and call Sakura's cell p h o n e . S h e 's
in the middle of work but says she can spare a couple m i nutes. That's fi n e , I
tell her.
' ' I ' m going back to Tokyo now," I tell her. 'Tm at Takamatsu Stati o n .
I j ust wanted t o t e l l you ."
"You 're finished running away from home?"
" I guess so."
" Fifteen 's a l i ttle early to run away, a nyway," she says . " B u t what are you
going to do back i n Tokyo? "
"Go back t o schoo!."
"That's probably a good idea," she says .
"You 're goi ng back to Tokyo too , aren't you ? "
"Ye a h , probably i n September. I might g o on a t r i p somewhere i n the
sum mer."
"Can I see you i n Tokyo?"
"Ye a h , of cours e ," she says . "Can you tell me your number?"
I give her the number at my house, and she writes i t down .
" I had a dream about you the other day," she says.
"I had one about you too ."
"A pretty raunchy one, I bet?"
"Could be ," I admit. "But it was j ust a drea m . What about yours ? "
" M i n e wasn't raunchy. You were i n th is huge h o u s e that w a s l ike a m a z e ,
walking around , searc h i ng for s o m e special roo m , but y o u c o ul d n't find i t .
There w a s somebody e l s e in t h e house, looking for you . I tried t o y e l l a warn­
ing, but you couldn't hear me. A pretty scary drea m . Whe n I woke up I was
exhausted from all that yel l i ng. I 've been worried about you ever s i n c e ."
" I appreciate it," I say. "But that's j ust a dream too . "

4 34

" Noth i n g bad happened to you ? "
" No, noth i ng b a d . "

No, nothing bad,

I t e l l myself.

"Good-bye , Kafka ," she says . "I have to get back to work, but if you ever
want to talk, j ust call me, okay? "
"Good-bye ," I say. " S ister," I add.

Over the bridge a n d across the water we go , and I transfer to the bullet tra i n
at Okayama Stati o n . I s i n k back in m y seat a n d close my eye s . My body grad­
ually adj usts to the tra i n 's vibratio n . The tightly wrapped p a i nting of Kafka 0 11

the Shore

is at my feet. I can feel it th ere .

" I want y o u t o remember m e ," M i s s Saeki says , and l ooks right i n to
my eye s .
" I f y o u r e m e m b e r m e , th e n I d o n ' t care if eve ryone else forgets ."

Time weighs down on you l ike an old, ambiguous drea m . You keep on m ov­
ing, trying to s l i p through it. But even if you go to the ends of th e earth , you
won't be able to escape it. Sti l l , you have to go th ere - to the edge of the
worl d . Th ere's someth i ng you can't do unless you get th ere .

I t starts t o ra i n j ust after w e pass Nagoya . I stare a t the drops streak i n g th e dark
window. It was ra i n i n g the day I left Tokyo , too . I p i cture ra i n fal l i ng i n a l l
sorts of p l a c e s - i n a forest, on th e sea, a h i ghway, a l i b rary. Ra i n fal l i n g at the
edge of th e worl d .
I c l o s e my eyes and relax, letting m y tense muscles g o l o o s e . I l isten t o the
steady hum of th e tra i n . And th e n , with out warning, a warm tear spills fro m
m y eye , r u n s down my c h e e k t o my mouth , an d, after a wh i l e , dries u p . N o
matter, I tel l myself. I t's j ust one tear. I t doesn't even feel l ike it's m i n e , more
l ike part of the ra i n outs i d e .
Did I do the right th i ng?
"You did the right th ing," the boy named C row says . "You did what was
best. No one else could have done as well as you did. After a l l , you 're the
genu ine a rti c l e : the toughest fifteen-yea r-old i n the worl d . "
" B u t I sti l l don't know a nyth ing about l i fe ," I protest.
" Look at th e painting," he says . "And l i sten to the w i n d . "
I nod.
" I know you can do it."

4 35

I nod aga i n .
"Yo u 'd better g e t s o m e sleep," the boy named C row says . "Wh e n you
wake u p , you'll be part of a brand-new world."
You fi nally fal l asleep. And when you wake u p , i t's true .
You are part o f a brand-new worl d .

A Note on the Type

The text of th i s book was set in Electra, a typeface designed by

either modern or old styl e . It is not based on any h istorical

the extre me contrasts between thick and th i n e l e me n ts that
